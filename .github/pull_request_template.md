## Static Language Check

- [ ] Static output avoids `killed`, `survived`, `untested`, `proven`, and `adequate`.
- [ ] Unknowns include stop reasons where applicable.

## CI Economics

Complete this section when the PR changes workflows, policy gates, branch
protection expectations, CI artifacts, report uploads, release checks, or the
cost/posture of existing lanes. Use `n/a` for ordinary PRs that do not affect
CI behavior.

- LEM impact:
- Workflows touched:
- Branch protection impact:
- Failure mode caught:
- Cheaper signal considered:
- Required lanes affected:
- Advisory lanes affected:
- On-demand/release lanes affected:
- Labels that alter behavior:
- Artifact families affected:
- Rollback path:

If rollback requires branch-protection or workflow-file changes, say so here
and split the PR unless the workflow change itself is the narrow reviewed
surface. If a CI-breaking rollback would need emergency procedures because
normal CI cannot validate the revert, document that explicitly.

## Engineering Check

- [ ] No new `panic`, `unwrap`, `expect`, `todo`, or `unimplemented` in production code.

- [ ] New generated, dependency, process-spawn, or network surfaces are allowlisted with owner and reason.
- [ ] Errors are reported with actionable context.
- [ ] Public JSON/schema changes are documented.
