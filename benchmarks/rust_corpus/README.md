# Rust repository corpus

`benchmarks/rust_corpus/manifest.json` pins the real Rust repositories that
ripr has to work well on. Scoreboards, verdict checks, CPU, memory and size
measurements, mutation spot-checks, and first-run tests all run against this
one corpus, so their results are comparable and are not drawn only from
serde, ripgrep, regex, and ripr itself.

The corpus is a deliberate mix of three profile classes:

- **good**: well-maintained, carefully reviewed code in current idioms. ripr
  should be precise here.
- **legacy**: long-lived or abandoned code with older idioms (2015 edition,
  `extern crate`, `try!`), large modules, or thin tests. ripr should stay
  honest and fail closed rather than guess.
- **common**: ordinary team or community code, the kind most users have.
  ripr should be useful here without tuning.

The class is a judgment recorded per repo with the style it represents, and
it is backed by the probe counts. It is not a measurement.

Each repository is pinned to one upstream commit (`sha`) and that commit's
first parent (`base_sha`). A subject therefore has a whole-repository state
and a real upstream diff, the change a reviewer actually saw:

```bash
cargo xtask rust-corpus fetch --allow-network --tier fast
cargo xtask rust-corpus list --tier fast    # id, tier, path, base_sha, sha
cargo xtask rust-corpus smoke --tier fast   # run ripr on every pinned diff
ripr check --root target/ripr/corpus/tokio --base <base_sha> --format json
```

`fetch` writes `target/ripr/corpus/<id>` and `target/ripr/corpus/index.json`
(paths, pins, roles, profile, stresses, probe counts). It fetches only the
two pinned commits per repository (`git fetch --depth 2 <sha>`), verifies
HEAD and its first parent against the manifest. It reuses an existing
checkout only when the pins match and no tracked file is modified, so a
lane that edited a checkout gets the pinned state back on the next fetch.
Untracked build output does not force a refetch. `--repo <id>` selects individual repositories. Fetching is opt-in
network and never runs on the default CI path. `cargo xtask rust-corpus check`
is the offline manifest validator, and the committed manifest is also checked
by an xtask unit test.

`smoke` runs `ripr check --base <base_sha> --format json` on each fetched
repo and writes `target/ripr/reports/rust-corpus-smoke.{json,md}` with run
status, exit code, wall time, and finding counts per repo and profile class.
A missing checkout, a timeout, unparseable output, or a fail-closed run
status makes the receipt `inconclusive`. The receipt says nothing about
whether the verdicts are correct, and it does not measure memory.

## Tiers

| Tier | Selects | Repos | Checked out |
|------|---------|------:|------------:|
| fast | `tier = fast` | 20 | ~98 MB |
| full | every repo | 31 | ~403 MB |
| targets | `roles` contains `integration_target` | 6 | n/a |

Use `fast` for pull-request and quick local runs, and `full` for nightly and
release measurement. `full` adds the large workspaces and monorepos. Each
profile class is required in both `fast` and `full`. The `targets` tier
selects the repositories ripr intends to integrate with or be used on (no
upstream contact implied). Some are also representative repos, so they are
pinned only once.

The manifest's `why` field explains each entry, and `profile.style` names the
style it represents. Its `probe` block records lexical counts at the pin:
Rust files and lines, Cargo manifests, build.rs scripts, proc-macro crates,
no_std files, `harness = false` targets, `extern crate` files, files over
3,000 lines, and checkout size. Probe counts describe the subject. They are
not ripr results.

`check` requires every declared stress category to be covered by at least
one repository. A category that is not `full_only` must also be covered by a
fast-tier repository. The `full_only` categories are large_monorepo,
large_workspace, wasm_target, async_no_std, and loom_model_tests.

## Known gaps

`known_gaps` in the manifest lists what the corpus does not yet represent: a
nextest-only test configuration, a cfg(windows)-dominant crate, and tests
that live in another repository. Python subjects stay in
`fixtures/python-eval-sweep/manifest.json`.

## Changing the corpus

Pins are exact. Refreshing a pin, adding a repository, or changing a tier,
role, or profile is a new `corpus_version`, so results recorded against an
earlier version stay attributable. Apply the manifest's `selection_rule`
when choosing a pin: the most recent first-parent commit whose diff changes
1 to 12 non-test `.rs` files and 6 to 400 Rust lines, preferring behavior
fixes over chores. Archived repositories pin their last qualifying change.
Run `cargo xtask rust-corpus check`, then `fetch` the changed entries. The
fetch fails if the commit or its first parent does not match the pins.
