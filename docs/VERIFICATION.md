# Verification

`ripr` has three verification surfaces:

- README badges are public, repo-scoped trust markers.
- Pull request evidence is diff-scoped reviewer and agent feedback.
- Release evidence is shipped-truth proof for public version handoff.

Badges are the front panel. Generated evidence, CI receipts, and release artifacts remain the source of truth.

For the current maturity boundary across Rust, preview languages, PR cockpit,
agent packets, badges, and gates, see [Support tiers](status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md).
For the portable contract that adopted Rust repos should share, see
[Verification contracts](verification/README.md).

## README badges

### `ripr+`

`ripr+` is a repo-scoped static evidence badge. It counts unresolved static exposure gaps plus actionable test-efficiency findings under repository policy.

It is an inbox-zero signal, not coverage, runtime mutation proof, or correctness proof. Diff-scoped `ripr` artifacts belong in pull request summaries and CI artifacts, not public README badges.

### Release

The release badge shows the latest GitHub release. GitHub releases are the public version surface for this repository; crates.io downloads and docs.rs remain registry and documentation surfaces.

## Regeneration

Regenerate public badge endpoints:

```bash
cargo xtask badges
```

Regenerate them from an explicit policy-backed gap decision ledger:

```bash
cargo xtask badges --gap-ledger target/ripr/reports/gap-decision-ledger.json
```

Check committed endpoint drift:

```bash
cargo xtask badges --check
cargo xtask badges --check --gap-ledger target/ripr/reports/gap-decision-ledger.json
```

Committed endpoint files live under `badges/`. Detailed reports stay under `target/` locally or in CI artifacts.

## Pull Request Evidence

Pull requests run advisory `ripr` evidence, impacted evidence, fast gates, docs-sync, publish preflight, example smoke checks, and targeted mutation when routing rules require it.

`ripr` may suggest focused tests or route targeted mutation. It does not edit code, generate tests, run mutation, or make merge decisions by default.

Pull request artifacts and summaries are diff-scoped. They must not be reused as repo-scope README badges.
