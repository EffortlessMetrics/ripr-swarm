# RIPR-SPEC-0224: Examined-test miss evidence

Status: proposed

Owner: analysis

Created: 2026-10-04

Linked issues:

- #5344 (finding says "Related tests were found" while listing none)
- #5329 (finding reports `reach: yes` with `related_tests_total: 0`)
- #5356 (`ripr explain` repeats the human-full block)

Support-tier impact:

- None. No language support claim changes; the slice discloses facts the Rust
  classifier already computes.
  [docs/status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md](../status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md)

Policy impact:

- Adds the controlled output enum `related_test_miss` to
  `policy/output_contracts.txt` and `docs/OUTPUT_SCHEMA.md`. No gate, badge,
  or report file changes.

## Problem

A gap finding named at most the tests whose assertions matched the change. A
related test whose assertions all failed to match was dropped, so the finding
could say "Related tests were found" and `reach: yes` while listing no test
(16 findings across 4 of 12 shared-corpus repos, #5344). Where tests were
listed, the finding did not say why each one fails to catch the change, so a
developer who disagreed had to re-derive the analysis.

## Behavior

- Every related test the Rust classifier examines is retained in
  `related_tests`, including a test whose assertions match nothing. Such a
  test carries its first assertion as `oracle` (checked text), `oracle_kind:
  unknown` and `oracle_strength: none`, so it never supplies an oracle.
- Each retained test may carry `miss`, a `RelatedTestMiss` naming why it would
  not notice the change: `no_call_path`, `no_assertion`,
  `assertion_not_observing`, `assertion_not_credited`, `weak_assertion`,
  `missing_input`, `observation_unconfirmed`. The analyzer sets the first four
  while matching assertions; the finding builder sets `no_call_path` for
  `no_static_path`, and `weak_assertion`, `missing_input` and
  `observation_unconfirmed` for `weakly_exposed` and `reachable_unrevealed`.
  `exposed` and the unknown classes get no miss: ripr does not claim a miss it
  has not established.
- `miss` is evidence only. No stage, class, confidence, stop reason, or next
  step reads it. Post-classification gates that asked whether any related
  test survived oracle matching use `Finding::oracle_related_tests`, which
  skips `assertion_not_observing` rows, so their decisions are unchanged.
- A test that supplied an oracle row always ranks ahead of an
  `assertion_not_observing` row, so the eight-row window never loses a
  matched test to an examined miss.
- One prose owner, `output::related_test_miss`, renders the reason. The human
  digest appends it in parentheses after the related test; human-full prints
  `misses: <why>; checked <assertion>`; JSON, the context packet and MCP gap
  documents carry `miss` and `why`; LSP hover prints it, and diagnostics add up
  to three related-information rows that open the examined test.
- `ripr explain` adds a "Why this verdict" section: every retained examined
  test with its verdict and checked assertion, what a test would need to change
  the verdict (gap classes only), and the meaning of each stop reason.

## Required Evidence

- A unit test that a test whose assertions match nothing is listed as
  `assertion_not_observing` with `none` strength and `unknown` kind, and the
  stages stay `no`.
- A unit test that eight matched tests keep the window when a ninth examined
  miss exists, and the total counts all nine.
- A unit test that each miss renders a reason naming a checkable fact.
- Golden fixtures re-blessed with no change to any finding's classification,
  confidence, severity, stop reasons, missing entries, or next step.

## Non-Goals

- Changing any verdict. Whether a self-contradicting gap should become an
  unknown is RIPR-SPEC-0221's admission rule.
- Splitting `assertion_not_credited` into proven-inert and admission-unproven
  cases; that needs the typed admission refusal from #5359.
- Python, TypeScript, and Perl producers, which record no miss yet.

## Acceptance Examples

1. semver 1.0.23, `src/parse.rs:272` changed from `Some(&b'=')` to
   `Some(&b'>')`: the finding now lists `test_comparator_parse` with
   `miss: assertion_not_observing` and the checked
   `assert_to_string(parsed, "^1.2.3-alpha")`; before, it listed none while
   reporting `reach: yes`.
2. On the 20 fast-tier corpus repos, findings whose observe summary says
   "Related tests were found" with zero listed fall from 13 to 0, and
   `reach: yes` with zero listed falls from 5 to 0. Default human output keeps
   its line count (868 lines); JSON grows 5.1%.

## Test Mapping

- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/classify/reveal.rs::tests` — examined misses are
  listed and rank after matched tests.
- `crates/ripr/src/output/related_test_miss.rs::tests` — reason prose.
- Golden fixtures under `fixtures/*/expected/` — rendered parity.

## Implementation Mapping

| Surface | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/ripr/src/domain/probe.rs` | `RelatedTestMiss`, `RelatedTest::miss`, `Finding::oracle_related_tests` |
| `crates/ripr/src/analysis/classify/reveal.rs` | retain examined tests; set assertion-level misses; ranking |
| `crates/ripr/src/analysis/classifier/finding.rs` | class-level misses |
| `crates/ripr/src/output/related_test_miss.rs` | the one prose owner |
| `crates/ripr/src/output/human/{sections,evidence_lines,explain}.rs`, `output/json/report.rs`, `lsp/{hover,diagnostics}.rs`, `mcp/gaps.rs` | projections |

## Metrics

- `trust.self_contradictions` (dx-scoreboard rule R3): target 0.
- Share of gap findings whose listed tests carry a reason: 141 of 195 on the
  fast tier at this slice.
