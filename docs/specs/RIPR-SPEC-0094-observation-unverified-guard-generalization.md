Support-tier impact:

- Narrows false-actionable over-claims for ReturnValue, FieldConstruction,
  SideEffect, and CallDeletion probes. Also closes a type-blind hole in the
  MatchArm guard from RIPR-SPEC-0093. Honesty improvement only; no tier change.
  Claim boundaries remain governed by the canonical ledger in
  [support tiers](../status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md).

Policy impact:

- No new crates, binaries, dependencies, parsers, or LSP servers.
- Register this spec in `policy/doc-artifacts.toml`.
- No schema version bump. The `discriminate.summary` message for the unverified
  case changes text only (not a new JSON field).

## Behavior

When a probe belongs to a family where the changed sub-expression must be
directly witnessed by an assertion to justify `exposed` (ReturnValue,
FieldConstruction, SideEffect, CallDeletion, MatchArm), and no assertion
confirms observation of that changed expression, the discriminate stage is
marked `weak` and the finding is downgraded to `weakly_exposed`. The
discriminate summary contains `observation_unverified`.

Observation confirmation differs by family group:

- **Value families** (ReturnValue, FieldConstruction, MatchArm): the only
  static confirmation signal is a `token_match` — an assertion whose text
  contains an identifier token of length > 3 from the probe expression (for
  MatchArm, restricted to the variant tokens after `::`). A value assertion
  whose oracle kind merely *shape*-matches the seam (e.g. an `assert_eq!`
  comparing whole objects) does **not** confirm; it must name the changed
  sub-expression.
- **Effect families** (SideEffect, CallDeletion): the canonical observer of a
  side effect or outbound call is a mock/expectation, a snapshot, or a
  whole-object equality capturing the resulting persisted state. These
  kind-match the seam without sharing a probe token. A genuine effect observer
  (`effect_observer_confirms`: `MockExpectation | Snapshot |
  WholeObjectEquality`) therefore confirms observation in addition to
  `token_match`. A plain non-observing assertion (e.g. `assert!(result)`) that
  only fired via the single-assertion escape hatch is **not** an effect
  observer, so it stays `observation_unverified`.

## Problem

RIPR-SPEC-0093 introduced `arm_observation_unverified` for MatchArm only.
The same structural gap exists for four other families: ReturnValue,
FieldConstruction, SideEffect, and CallDeletion. Each can reach
`exposed`/1.00 via the `assertion_count == 1` escape hatch without any
assertion token referencing the changed sub-expression.

Additionally, inside the MatchArm guard, token_match was computed type-blind:
for `Mode::Frozen`, the tokens include `["Frozen", "Mode"]`. A sibling assertion
for `Mode::Warm` contains `"Mode"` (shared qualifier), which spuriously cleared
`observation_unverified` even though the test only exercises `Warm`.

## Fix

### Part A: Generalize the guard

Replace the `is_match_arm` single-family predicate with `needs_token_confirmation`
covering `{MatchArm, ReturnValue, FieldConstruction, SideEffect, CallDeletion}`.
Rename `arm_observation_unverified` to `observation_unverified`. Apply the
start-pessimistic / token_match-clears logic to all covered families. The
discriminate message when unverified becomes:
`"Discriminator unconfirmed: no assertion text references this probe's changed expression (observation_unverified)"`.

### Part B: Variant-scoped MatchArm token_match

Add `match_arm_variant_tokens(expression)` to extract only the variant tokens
(identifiers immediately after `::`) from the probe expression. For MatchArm,
`has_token_match` uses only these variant tokens, not the full token set. This
prevents the shared enum qualifier from confirming a sibling-arm assertion.

### Part C: Effect-family observers confirm without a token

For the **effect** families (SideEffect, CallDeletion), the changed behavior is
a side effect or outbound call whose legitimate observer is a mock/expectation
or a persisted-state snapshot/whole-object assertion that kind-matches the seam
without naming a probe token. Generalizing Part A on `token_match` alone would
wrongly flag a real mock observer as `observation_unverified`. Part C adds
`effect_observer_confirms(assertion)` (`MockExpectation | Snapshot |
WholeObjectEquality`) and ORs it into the clear-signal **for effect families
only**. This is intentionally narrower than `oracle_matches_family` for effect
families — it excludes the broad `text.contains("assert" | "expect")` substring
matches, so a plain non-observing assertion does not clear the guard. Value
families are unchanged: only a `token_match` clears them.

## Non-Goals

- Running mutations or dynamic analysis.
- Changing token confirmation for Predicate or ErrorPath probes. The
  name-only relation rule below is family-independent and does apply to them.
- Bumping the JSON schema version.
- Changing the oracle-strength → discriminate-state mapping. A Medium effect
  observer (bare `MockExpectation`) remains `weakly_exposed` via the existing
  strength path; `exposed` still requires a Strong (exact-value /
  whole-object) discriminator. Part C only fixes *which* observers clear
  `observation_unverified`; it does not promote Medium oracles to Strong.

## Required Evidence

Per-family fixture pairs (blind and confirmed) plus the MatchArm qualifier-blind lock.

## Inputs

- A diff changing a return expression, struct field initializer, side-effect call, or call-deletion.
- Related tests found by `find_related_tests`.

## Outputs

- `weakly_exposed` with `observation_unverified` when no confirming assertion
  exists (value family: no `token_match`; effect family: no `token_match` and
  no effect observer).
- `exposed` when the discriminator is confirmed AND strong: a `token_match`
  with a Strong oracle (value families), or a Strong effect observer
  (exact-value / whole-object persisted state) for effect families.
- `discriminate.summary` contains `"observation_unverified"` only when the
  guard fires; otherwise the summary reflects oracle strength.

## Acceptance Examples

### ReturnValue blind (must downgrade)

```
probe family:  return_value
expression:    base * 2
test:          assert!(compute_score(3) > 0);
Before fix:    exposed / confidence 1.0
After fix:     weakly_exposed / confidence 0.92 / observation_unverified
```

### ReturnValue confirmed (must stay exposed)

```
probe family:  return_value
expression:    x * SCALE_FACTOR
test:          assert_eq!(compute_score(3), 3 * SCALE_FACTOR);
After fix:     exposed / confidence 1.0 (SCALE_FACTOR token_match fires)
```

### MatchArm sibling-qualifier blind (Part B, must downgrade)

```
probe family:  match_arm
expression:    Mode::Frozen => -1,
test:          assert_eq!(classify(Mode::Warm), 1);
Before fix:    exposed / confidence 1.0
After fix:     weakly_exposed / confidence 0.92 / observation_unverified
```

### SideEffect / CallDeletion blind (must downgrade)

```
probe family:  call_deletion (effect)
expression:    notifier.send(order_id)
test:          assert!(result);              // plain assert, no mock, no token
After fix:     weakly_exposed / observation_unverified
```

### SideEffect / CallDeletion confirmed (Part C, must stay exposed)

```
probe family:  call_deletion (effect)
expression:    notifier.send(order_id)
test:          assert_eq!(*notifier.sent.borrow(), vec!["order-42".to_string()]);
After fix:     exposed   (strong persisted-state observer; token_match on
                          `notifier`; effect observer kind-matches the seam)
```

A bare Medium mock observer (`mock.verify();`, no token) clears
`observation_unverified` via Part C but remains `weakly_exposed` because Medium
strength maps to a weak discriminator — see Non-Goals.

## Strongest-oracle confirmation (#4404)

For the families requiring observation confirmation, oracle strength and its
confirmation must come from the same matched assertion. A weaker assertion
that names the changed expression cannot confirm an unrelated strongest
oracle, even when both assertions occur in one test. The same rule applies
across related tests and is independent of encounter order.

An equally strong confirmed assertion can supply discrimination in either
order. Related candidate assertions remain visible. When weaker confirmation
exists but the strongest oracle lacks its own confirmation, discrimination
stays weak and names `oracle_confirmation_mixed`; the existing
`observation_unverified` narration remains for cases with no confirmation.

This is a bounded correction to evidence aggregation. Existing confirmation
matchers remain heuristic: it does not establish general source-to-sink
identity or resolve literal-token coincidence independently.

Proof: `strongest_oracle_cannot_borrow_weaker_assertion_confirmation`,
`equally_strong_confirmed_oracle_preserves_discrimination_in_either_order`,
and the `oracle_confirmation_mixed` fixture registered in the honesty corpus.

## Direct collection StateWrite observer (#4575)

One effect family is admitted through the existing `PropagationWitnessV1`
direct-sink authority: a bare-identifier collection mutation such as
`items.push(5)` whose receiver is a passed mutable collection.

Confirmation for that family requires the assertion's **primary observed
subject** to be that same receiver:

- `assert_eq!(items, expected)` observes `items` and retains useful evidence.
- `assert_eq!(other, expected)` and `assert_eq!(other, items)` observe
  `other` and stay `observation_unverified`.
- A return-value assertion, a string containing the callee name, or an
  unrelated mock does not confirm the collection sink.

`self.field.push`, `cache.insert`, `items.insert`, helper/dynamic receivers,
and other effect families keep the existing Part C path. This does not absorb
oracle-pooling (#4404) or rewrite the shared witness type (#3160). The first
admitted method is `push` only; `insert` is a later sibling because it collides
with delivered CallDeletion goldens.

Proof: `mutating_collection_a_while_asserting_b_stays_unverified`,
`asserting_affected_collection_retains_confirmation_in_either_order`,
`direct_collection_push_completes_effect_target_and_rejects_wrong_observer`,
`direct_collection_state_write_requires_complete_witness`,
`cache_insert_call_deletion_keeps_legacy_syntax_propagation`, and
`direct_collection_mutation_discriminates_actual_observer_not_sibling_collection`.

## Name-only relations cannot supply the oracle (#4486)

A related test whose only tie to the owner is its name has no evidence of
running the changed code. The ties that count as name-only are
`weak_token_substring` (the name shares a changed token) and
`owner_named_test` (the name contains the owner's name, with no captured
call, helper chain or assertion affinity). When another related test reaches
the owner, a name-only test's assertions stay listed but cannot supply the
credited oracle strength, its confirmation, or clear `observation_unverified`.
Reach-bearing relations are the direct and helper owner calls, assertion
target affinity, and seam callee calls.

Same-file and same-module relations are neither reach-bearing nor name-only:
`reach.rs` already treats them as proximity without reach, so they do not
switch this rule on, and they keep crediting their own assertions because
they commonly exercise a private helper through the module's own entry point.
When no related test is reach-bearing, reach itself is `no` or `weak`, so the
finding cannot read `exposed`, and name-only assertions keep their previous
reading.

The rule is family-independent because it concerns which test supplies the
oracle, not how an assertion confirms the changed expression.

Proof: `name_only_test_cannot_supply_the_oracle_for_reach_from_another_test`
and the `proximity_name_oracle_not_credited` fixture, registered in the
honesty corpus.

## Test Mapping

- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/classify/reveal.rs` unit tests for all new families.
- Strongest-oracle confirmation: the two fallible classifier tests named above
  and `fixtures/oracle_confirmation_mixed`, registered in the honesty corpus.
- Name-only relations: `name_only_test_cannot_supply_the_oracle_for_reach_from_another_test`
  and `fixtures/proximity_name_oracle_not_credited`, registered in the honesty
  corpus.
- 9 new golden fixtures (see traceability.toml for the full list).
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/classifier.rs` — 2 existing tests updated.

## Implementation Mapping

- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/classify/reveal.rs`:
  - `needs_token_confirmation(family)` new predicate.
  - `match_arm_variant_tokens(expression)` new helper for Part B.
  - `is_effect_family(family)` + `effect_observer_confirms(assertion)` new
    helpers for Part C.
  - `RevealAssertionAnalysis.observation_unverified` (renamed).
  - `RevealAssertionAnalysis.strongest_observation_confirmed` keeps confirmation
    on the assertion supplying the selected strength and kind.
  - `analyze_related_assertions` computes `observation_confirmed =
    has_token_match || (is_effect_family && effect_observer_confirms)`, except
    the direct collection StateWrite family (#4575) which requires the
    assertion's primary observed subject to be the mutated receiver.
  - `assertion_matches_probe_detail` receives `match_arm_variants` param.
  - `build_discriminate_evidence` updated message.

## CI Proof

- `cargo xtask goldens check`
- `cargo test -p ripr`

## Metrics

- `observation_unverified_downgrades_non_match_arm_to_weakly_exposed`: each
  blind fixture produces `weakly_exposed` with `observation_unverified` in the
  discriminate summary.

No tier change required. Honesty narrowing within the existing `usable alpha` Rust exposure loop.
