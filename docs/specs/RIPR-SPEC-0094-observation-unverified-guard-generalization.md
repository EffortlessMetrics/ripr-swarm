Support-tier impact:

- Narrows false-actionable over-claims for ReturnValue, FieldConstruction,
  SideEffect, and CallDeletion probes. Also closes a type-blind hole in the
  MatchArm guard from RIPR-SPEC-0093. Honesty improvement only; no tier change.
  Claim boundaries remain governed by the canonical ledger in
  [support tiers](../status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md).

Policy impact:

- No new crates, binaries, dependencies, parsers, or LSP servers.
- Register this spec in `policy/doc-artifacts.toml`.
- No schema version bump. The `discriminate.summary` message for the unverified
  case changes text only (not a new JSON field).

## Behavior

When a probe belongs to a family where the changed sub-expression must be
directly witnessed by an assertion to justify `exposed` (ReturnValue,
FieldConstruction, SideEffect, CallDeletion, MatchArm), and no assertion
confirms observation of that changed expression, the discriminate stage is
marked `weak` and the finding is downgraded to `weakly_exposed`. The
discriminate summary contains `observation_unverified`.

Observation confirmation differs by family group:

- **Value families** (ReturnValue, FieldConstruction, MatchArm): the only
  static confirmation signal is a `token_match` — an assertion whose text
  contains an identifier token of length > 3 from the probe expression (for
  MatchArm, restricted to the variant tokens after `::`). A value assertion
  whose oracle kind merely *shape*-matches the seam (e.g. an `assert_eq!`
  comparing whole objects) does **not** confirm; it must name the changed
  sub-expression.
- **Effect families** (SideEffect, CallDeletion): the canonical observer of a
  side effect or outbound call is a mock/expectation, a snapshot, or a
  whole-object equality capturing the resulting persisted state. These
  kind-match the seam without sharing a probe token. A genuine effect observer
  (`effect_observer_confirms`: `MockExpectation | Snapshot |
  WholeObjectEquality`) therefore confirms observation in addition to
  `token_match`. A plain non-observing assertion (e.g. `assert!(result)`) that
  only fired via the single-assertion escape hatch is **not** an effect
  observer, so it stays `observation_unverified`.

## Problem

RIPR-SPEC-0093 introduced `arm_observation_unverified` for MatchArm only.
The same structural gap exists for four other families: ReturnValue,
FieldConstruction, SideEffect, and CallDeletion. Each can reach
`exposed`/1.00 via the `assertion_count == 1` escape hatch without any
assertion token referencing the changed sub-expression.

Additionally, inside the MatchArm guard, token_match was computed type-blind:
for `Mode::Frozen`, the tokens include `["Frozen", "Mode"]`. A sibling assertion
for `Mode::Warm` contains `"Mode"` (shared qualifier), which spuriously cleared
`observation_unverified` even though the test only exercises `Warm`.

## Fix

### Part A: Generalize the guard

Replace the `is_match_arm` single-family predicate with `needs_token_confirmation`
covering `{MatchArm, ReturnValue, FieldConstruction, SideEffect, CallDeletion}`.
Rename `arm_observation_unverified` to `observation_unverified`. Apply the
start-pessimistic / token_match-clears logic to all covered families. The
discriminate message when unverified becomes:
`"Discriminator unconfirmed: no assertion text references this probe's changed expression (observation_unverified)"`.

### Part B: Variant-scoped MatchArm token_match

Add `match_arm_variant_tokens(expression)` to extract only the variant tokens
(identifiers immediately after `::`) from the probe expression. For MatchArm,
`has_token_match` uses only these variant tokens, not the full token set. This
prevents the shared enum qualifier from confirming a sibling-arm assertion.

### Part C: Effect-family observers confirm without a token

For the **effect** families (SideEffect, CallDeletion), the changed behavior is
a side effect or outbound call whose legitimate observer is a mock/expectation
or a persisted-state snapshot/whole-object assertion that kind-matches the seam
without naming a probe token. Generalizing Part A on `token_match` alone would
wrongly flag a real mock observer as `observation_unverified`. Part C adds
`effect_observer_confirms(assertion)` (`MockExpectation | Snapshot |
WholeObjectEquality`) and ORs it into the clear-signal **for effect families
only**. This is intentionally narrower than `oracle_matches_family` for effect
families — it excludes the broad `text.contains("assert" | "expect")` substring
matches, so a plain non-observing assertion does not clear the guard. Value
families are unchanged: only a `token_match` clears them.

## Non-Goals

- Running mutations or dynamic analysis.
- Changing token confirmation for Predicate or ErrorPath probes. The
  name-only relation rule below is family-independent and does apply to them.
- Bumping the JSON schema version.
- Changing the oracle-strength → discriminate-state mapping. A Medium effect
  observer (bare `MockExpectation`) remains `weakly_exposed` via the existing
  strength path; `exposed` still requires a Strong (exact-value /
  whole-object) discriminator. Part C only fixes *which* observers clear
  `observation_unverified`; it does not promote Medium oracles to Strong.

## Required Evidence

Per-family fixture pairs (blind and confirmed) plus the MatchArm qualifier-blind lock.

## Inputs

- A diff changing a return expression, struct field initializer, side-effect call, or call-deletion.
- Related tests found by `find_related_tests`.

## Outputs

- `weakly_exposed` with `observation_unverified` when no confirming assertion
  exists (value family: no `token_match`; effect family: no `token_match` and
  no effect observer).
- `exposed` when the discriminator is confirmed AND strong: a `token_match`
  with a Strong oracle (value families), or a Strong effect observer
  (exact-value / whole-object persisted state) for effect families.
- `discriminate.summary` contains `"observation_unverified"` only when the
  guard fires; otherwise the summary reflects oracle strength.

## Acceptance Examples

### ReturnValue blind (must downgrade)

```
probe family:  return_value
expression:    base * 2
test:          assert!(compute_score(3) > 0);
Before fix:    exposed / confidence 1.0
After fix:     weakly_exposed / confidence 0.92 / observation_unverified
```

### ReturnValue confirmed (must stay exposed)

```
probe family:  return_value
expression:    x * SCALE_FACTOR
test:          assert_eq!(compute_score(3), 3 * SCALE_FACTOR);
After fix:     exposed / confidence 1.0 (SCALE_FACTOR token_match fires)
```

### MatchArm sibling-qualifier blind (Part B, must downgrade)

```
probe family:  match_arm
expression:    Mode::Frozen => -1,
test:          assert_eq!(classify(Mode::Warm), 1);
Before fix:    exposed / confidence 1.0
After fix:     weakly_exposed / confidence 0.92 / observation_unverified
```

### SideEffect / CallDeletion blind (must downgrade)

```
probe family:  call_deletion (effect)
expression:    notifier.send(order_id)
test:          assert!(result);              // plain assert, no mock, no token
After fix:     weakly_exposed / observation_unverified
```

### SideEffect / CallDeletion confirmed (Part C, must stay exposed)

```
probe family:  call_deletion (effect)
expression:    notifier.send(order_id)
test:          assert_eq!(*notifier.sent.borrow(), vec!["order-42".to_string()]);
After fix:     exposed   (strong persisted-state observer; token_match on
                          `notifier`; effect observer kind-matches the seam)
```

A bare Medium mock observer (`mock.verify();`, no token) clears
`observation_unverified` via Part C but remains `weakly_exposed` because Medium
strength maps to a weak discriminator — see Non-Goals.

## Strongest-oracle confirmation (#4404)

For the families requiring observation confirmation, oracle strength and its
confirmation must come from the same matched assertion. A weaker assertion
that names the changed expression cannot confirm an unrelated strongest
oracle, even when both assertions occur in one test. The same rule applies
across related tests and is independent of encounter order.

An equally strong confirmed assertion can supply discrimination in either
order. Related candidate assertions remain visible. When weaker confirmation
exists but the strongest oracle lacks its own confirmation, discrimination
stays weak and names `oracle_confirmation_mixed`; the existing
`observation_unverified` narration remains for cases with no confirmation.

This is a bounded correction to evidence aggregation. Existing confirmation
matchers remain heuristic: it does not establish general source-to-sink
identity or resolve literal-token coincidence independently.

Proof: `strongest_oracle_cannot_borrow_weaker_assertion_confirmation`,
`equally_strong_confirmed_oracle_preserves_discrimination_in_either_order`,
and the `oracle_confirmation_mixed` fixture registered in the honesty corpus.

## Direct collection StateWrite observer (#4575)

One effect family is admitted through the existing `PropagationWitnessV1`
direct-sink authority: a bare-identifier collection mutation such as
`items.push(5)` whose receiver is a passed mutable collection.

Confirmation for that family requires the assertion's **primary observed
subject** to be that same receiver:

- `assert_eq!(items, expected)` observes `items` and retains useful evidence.
- `assert_eq!(items.len(), 1)` observes a read of `items`.
- `assert_eq!(other, expected)` and `assert_eq!(other, items)` observe
  `other` and stay `observation_unverified`.
- `assert_eq!(items.clear(), ())` and `assert_eq!(items.push(1), ())` observe
  the mutating call's return, not the collection, and stay unverified.
- A quoted `assert_eq!(items, …)` inside another assertion does not confirm
  the collection sink.
- A return-value assertion, a string containing the callee name, or an
  unrelated mock does not confirm the collection sink.

`self.field.push`, `cache.insert`, `items.insert`, helper/dynamic receivers,
and other effect families keep the existing Part C path. This does not absorb
oracle-pooling (#4404) or rewrite the shared witness type (#3160). The first
admitted method is `push` only; `insert` is a later sibling because it collides
with delivered CallDeletion goldens.

`asserting_affected_collection_retains_confirmation_in_either_order`,
`direct_collection_push_completes_effect_target_and_rejects_wrong_observer`,
`direct_collection_state_write_requires_complete_witness`,
`cache_insert_call_deletion_keeps_legacy_syntax_propagation`, and
`direct_collection_mutation_discriminates_actual_observer_not_sibling_collection`.

## Part D: a whole-object effect observer must be able to carry the effect

Part C lets any whole-object equality confirm an effect-family probe. That is
sound only when the compared object can hold the state the effect writes. The
verdict-corpus case `ledger-receive-refresh-low-stock` inserts
`self.refresh_low_stock(sku);` into `Inventory::receive`; the helper writes
only `self.low_stock`, read only by `is_low`, and no test reads `is_low` after
a `receive`. `assert_eq!(inv.history(), &[..])` and
`assert_eq!(receipt, Receipt { .. })` confirmed the call, so the finding read
`exposed` although the mutant's tests passed.

The owner side is established once per probe (`EffectStateCarrier`) and only
when the written state is statically bounded:

- the probe is a `CallDeletion` or `SideEffect` probe;
- the changed expression is exactly `self.callee(args)`, with no `?` and no
  `&mut` argument, in a method of an inherent or trait impl in a
  parser-backed file;
- `callee` resolves to exactly one `&mut self` method (a by-value `mut self`
  does not count) of the same self type with no return type and no `&mut`
  parameter, and no trait, unparsed or other-type method shares its name;
- the callee and every `self.method(..)` it calls transitively touch state
  only through `self.<field>`: no bare `self`, no free function call, no
  path-qualified call (`Audit::record(..)`, `crate::audit::record(..)`, and
  also `Self::record()`, which is not traversed) outside std roots (`std`,
  `core`, `alloc` and the primitive types), no field method outside the
  read-only list and known collection mutators (`self.file.write_all(..)`
  and `self.sink.publish(..)` are out), no chained method outside those
  lists and the entry/`Option` chain helpers (`or_insert`, `unwrap`, ...;
  `self.journal.as_ref().write_all(..)` and `self.tx.clone().send(..)` are
  out), no turbofish method call outside those lists
  (`self.events.record::<Low>(..)`), no std path into `fs`, `io`, `env`, `net`, `process`,
  `sync` or `thread`, no method call on a parameter or local outside the
  read-only and pure by-value list (`sink.record(..)` is out, `sku.trim()`
  is in), no `borrow`/`get_mut` handle access, no non-pure macro, no `ref mut` pattern, no interior
  mutability marker or `unsafe`, and every transitive self call resolves the
  same way;
- the callee writes at least one field, and the self type's single braced
  `struct` declares every written field with std collections, `Option` and
  primitives only (a user type's `push` or `AddAssign`, or a user key's
  `Ord`, runs user code);
- the workspace index is complete, since an omitted file may hold a
  same-name method, a `Drop` impl or the type's definition;
- the workspace has no user `Drop` impl, since a collection mutator that
  removes or replaces a value would run it;
- the owner itself, apart from the changed call, reads no written field,
  uses no bare `self` and calls no other reading self method. An owner that
  reads the state back (`if self.low_stock.contains(sku) { self.log.push(..) }`)
  can move it into any field a whole-object equality compares.

A field counts as written for an assignment, a compound assignment, a
`&mut self.field` borrow, an index, or a method call on it outside a fixed
read-only list (`get`, `contains`, `len`, `iter`, ...). A self-type method
reads a written field when it uses the field other than as a discarded
statement-level store (`insert`, `push`, `remove`, `clear`, ...), passes the
whole receiver (including an inline `format!("{self:?}")` capture), or calls
a reading or unresolved self method.

With a carrier established, a whole-object equality confirms the effect
only when one of its identifiers may hold a written field: the field itself,
a reading method, the self type's name, a method name defined on another
type or in a trait, or a binding that is not provably non-carrying. A
binding is provably non-carrying only when its single `let` initializer in
the test is itself non-carrying, for example a value returned by a resolved,
non-reading method of the self type (`let receipt = inv.ship(..).unwrap();`).
A binding with no `let`, several `let`s, or an unresolved method call on it
(`inv.clone()`) is followed to its initializer or treated as a carrier. A
`let` annotated with the self type, any `let mut` binding, a macro
initializer (`format!("{inv:?}")` may capture the receiver), and any shared
handle (`Rc`, `Arc`, `Weak`) carry.
A field read on a binding (`receipt.sku`) is decided at the field when the
field belongs to the self type; any other field (`app.inventory`) may hold
the receiver, so its binding is resolved as above. A call through a std or
primitive path (`u32::from(..)`, `String::from(..)`, `Vec::<Event>::new()`)
is decided by its arguments; any other free or module-path call
(`setup()`, `fixtures::stocked()`, or an associated function of a non-std
type such as `TestBed::with_inventory()`) may return the receiver and carries.

State can also reach a non-reading observer through a later test action. When
the test calls a `&mut self` method of the self type, other than the owner,
that reads a written field (`inv.reorder()` turning `low_stock` into log
entries, or `Inventory::reorder(&mut inv)`), or a `&self` reader that also
reaches outside the object (one writing the field to a file), every
whole-object equality in that test is admitted, because the observed field
may now depend on the written one. Call order is not established, since the owner may be reached
indirectly. A `&mut self` method that reads no written field (`inv.ship(..)`
in the corpus case) does not admit: it cannot move the written state. A
test that takes a `&mut` borrow of a binding (`restock(&mut inv)`,
`let r = &mut inv;`) other than as an argument to a resolved non-reading
method of the self type, that passes a binding by value or shared reference
as a call argument (`publish(&inv)`, `audit.record(inv)`), or that reassigns a
binding (`inv = restocked(inv);`), is admitted too, since a helper may call a
reader or read the field itself.

When any owner-side gate fails, the Part C reading stands: any whole-object
equality confirms. Refusing the confirmation would turn `exposed` into an
actionable gap, and a wrong actionable signal is worse than a missed
advisory, so an unbounded effect keeps the credit. Mock expectations and
snapshots are never refused, and a `token_match` still confirms on its own.

Residuals: methods generated by derive or attribute macros are invisible to
the reader scan (an unresolved method on a binding falls back to that
binding's initializer), and state shared through `Rc`/`Arc` without an
interior-mutability marker in the scanned bodies is not detected.

`ledger-receive-refresh-low-stock`, which moves from `false_exposed` to
`ideal` (`weakly_exposed`, `observation_unverified`).

## Name-only relations cannot supply the oracle (#4486)

A related test whose only tie to the owner is its name has no evidence of
running the changed code. The ties that count as name-only are
`weak_token_substring` (the name shares a changed token) and
`owner_named_test` (the name contains the owner's name, with no captured
call, helper chain or assertion affinity). When another related test reaches
the owner, a name-only test's assertions stay listed but cannot supply the
credited oracle strength, its confirmation, or clear `observation_unverified`.
Reach-bearing relations are the direct and helper owner calls, assertion
target affinity, and seam callee calls.

Same-file and same-module relations are neither reach-bearing nor name-only:
`reach.rs` already treats them as proximity without reach, so they do not
switch this rule on, and they keep crediting their own assertions because
they commonly exercise a private helper through the module's own entry point.
When no related test is reach-bearing, reach itself is `no` or `weak`, so the
finding cannot read `exposed`, and name-only assertions keep their previous
reading.

The rule is family-independent because it concerns which test supplies the
oracle, not how an assertion confirms the changed expression.

## Same-file tests cannot confirm a match arm beside a reaching test (#6297)

A match arm's variant token (`Unit::Fortnight`) names an enum value that every
function handling the enum shares, so naming it does not tie an assertion to
the changed owner. When a related test is reach-bearing (as defined above,
except a seam callee call, which runs the seam's callee rather than the owner),
a test related only by `same_test_file` or `same_module` still credits its
oracle strength but cannot confirm a match arm's observation unless it may run
the owner. It may when its body invokes a macro other than the assertion and
formatting macros, or when it calls the owner, a production function with a
name path to the owner within the transitive-reach bound (RIPR-SPEC-0114), or
a lower-case name with no indexed function (a std or trait method can dispatch
into the owner). It also may when the owner is, or its name path runs through,
a trait method Rust calls without naming it (`fmt` behind `format!`, `eq` behind `==`,
`add`, `index`, `deref`, `next`, `drop` and the like), since such a call leaves
no call fact. Only a trait impl or trait method of that name counts; a free or
inherent `fn fmt` or `fn clone` is reached by name only, and an unknown
container (lexical fallback) counts. Only a test whose calls are all constructors or indexed
functions with no name path to the owner is withheld. When no related test is
reach-bearing, same-file and same-module tests confirm as before.

Without this rule a same-file
`assert!(matches!(Unit::from_str("fortnight"), Ok(Unit::Fortnight)))` made the
`Unit::Fortnight =>` arm of an unrelated `seconds` function `exposed`, and
rewriting only that assertion moved the arm to `weakly_exposed`.

The rule covers match arms and, since #7063, an exact error variant. An
`error_path` or `return_value` probe whose changed expression constructs
`Err(E::Variant)` (including the turbofish form `Err::<T, E>(E::Variant)`)
names a variant every function returning `E` shares, so a same-file
`assert!(matches!(refund(20_000), Err(PayError::Limit)))` cannot confirm
`deposit_cap`'s `return Err(PayError::Limit)` beside a test that calls
`deposit_cap`. Its summary names the error variant instead of the arm. Any
other return-value token names the changed expression itself, and the #4486
same-file credit stays for other families.

When the arm stays unconfirmed and such a test was withheld, the discriminator
summary says that a test which only shares the file or module cannot confirm
the arm, instead of claiming no assertion names it.

Proof: `match_arm_proximity_test_cannot_confirm_beside_reaching_test`, the
`match_arm_proximity_confirmation_not_credited` fixture, and its control
`match_arm_proximity_wrapper_confirms` (a same-file test of a public wrapper
keeps `exposed`), both registered in the honesty corpus.

## Owner-scoped tokens and self-computed expected values (#5830)

A token confirms observation only when the shared word can name the same
thing in the test. On a `return_value` or `field_construction` probe, three
kinds of token in the changed expression cannot:

- a name the owner's signature binds as a parameter;
- a name the owner binds with `let`;
- a numeric literal.

A test never holds the owner's binding, and a number in the changed
expression matches any test input with the same digits. Such a token
confirms observation only in an assertion that calls the owner, as
`tax(subtotal)` does for `fn tax(subtotal: i64)`. In
`assert_eq!(subtotal(3, 100), 300)` the words `subtotal` and `100` are
coincidence for a changed `subtotal * 8 / 100` in `tax`. Field names,
called functions, methods and constants in the changed expression confirm
as before. The constructed field's own name confirms even when it is also a
parameter (`storage` in the shorthand `HirLet { storage }`), and an
assertion naming a test `let` bound from an owner call counts as calling
the owner. Effect families keep their existing token rule.

The owner-return pin (#4478) is then the path that credits an exact pin
such as `assert_eq!(sku_family("BOLT-M8"), "BOLT")`. Its return-path gate
now reads the owner's tail past a comment (`// SAFETY:` before an `unsafe`
block), so that pin still confirms once the parameter token no longer
does.

An `assert_eq!` whose one operand calls the owner, and whose other operand
calls a function that reaches the owner within six call hops (a
`#[cfg(test)]` helper such as `reference_tax` counts), computes its
expected value through the changed code (RIPR-SPEC-0035, self-computed
expected value). In `assert_eq!(invoice(3, 100), sub + tax(sub))`, where
`invoice` calls `tax`, both sides move with `tax`. Owner calls on both
sides count too when the identifiers and literals outside those calls are
the same (`assert_eq!(tax(250) * 2, 2 * tax(250))`); when they differ
(`tax(250) * 2` against `tax(250) + 8`), the assertion can pin the owner's
value and keeps its strength. Such an assertion never
confirms observation, and its probe-relative strength is at most `weak`, for
every family. Callers are found over indexed call facts, and a call counts
only when its own syntax can name the callee: a bare call or a lower-case
module path outside `std`, `core` and `alloc` for a free function;
`Type::name`, or `Self::name` or `self.name(` inside the same impl, for an
associated function. So `values.len()` never reaches an owner `Stack::len`.
On the expected side, a type-qualified call (`Money::new(8)`) reaches the
owner only through a caller in that type's impl; any other call matches a
caller by name alone, so a same-named function elsewhere can only withhold
credit. An expected side that is a literal, or that calls
only functions that do not reach the owner, keeps the assertion's strength.
A value bound from the owner in an earlier `let` is not followed. When no
test reaches the owner (reach ruled out), any `weak` infection, observation
or discrimination stage reads as unreached, like a `yes` stage, because a
test that never runs the owner activates, observes and discriminates
nothing. These
rules govern diff-mode reveal; repo exposure grading (`test_grip_evidence`)
does not apply them yet.
