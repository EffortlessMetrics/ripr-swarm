# RIPR-SPEC-0214: MCP repair transaction projection — prepare, attempt reads, and receipt status

Status: proposed

Owner: mcp

Created: 2026-10-03

Linked issues:

- #3090 (this slice: `ripr_prepare_repair`, `ripr_get_repair_attempt`,
  `ripr_get_receipt_status`, and the repair-attempt / receipt resources)
- #5268 (the discriminator gate names the unpopulated language-producer
  state instead of contradicting the same document's
  `discriminator_availability` block; populating canonical gaps for Rust
  findings stays the producer follow-up)
- #5199 (terminal receipt completeness and open-gap projection repair)
- #3087 (parent standard MCP server epic)
- #3088 (transport/discovery/read-only boundary slice; this slice keeps its
  SDK-owned dispatch and bounded framing)
- #3089 / RIPR-SPEC-0211 (sibling session-evidence slice; this slice
  supersedes its hard `repair_packet_ready: false` readiness pin with the
  committed producer repair-readiness evaluation and owns binding the
  repair boundary and repair-attempt link)
- #4668 (RepairCard MCP projection consumer; the seam list this slice
  exposes lets that work proceed)
- #5399 (durable read-time HEAD applicability and continuation parity;
  producer completeness remains separately owned by #5199)
- #5608 / #5744 (selected restart root and producer manifest root preserve
  literal Unix filename characters; canonical root admission stays intact)
- ADR 0022 (bounded read-only MCP adapter; this slice adds no execution
  authority)

Support-tier impact:

- None. The slice projects producer facts the CLI and LSP already compute;
  it adds no language support claim and runs no new analysis.
  [docs/status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md](../status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md)

Policy impact:

- None. No new output format, gate, badge, or report file is added; the
  repair documents are wire payloads bounded by the existing MCP byte caps.
  The wire failure vocabulary gains two typed codes (`attempt_not_found`,
  `attempt_invalid`); the reserved `superseded` code becomes reachable for
  session transactions bound to a non-current snapshot.

## Problem

An agent that found one actionable gap through the session-evidence slice
(RIPR-SPEC-0211) still had to leave the protocol to assemble a bounded
repair packet: no route named the committed readiness facts, no transaction
identity bound the evidence to one snapshot and item, and the durable
CLI-owned repair attempts and receipts were invisible to the adapter. Slice
B deliberately pinned readiness as a hard negative and left the
repair-attempt link an explicit null so this slice could extend the
documents without a breaking change.

## Behavior

`ripr mcp --stdio` gains three tools and two resource templates, all
read-only and without execution authority (ADR 0022):

- Tools `ripr_prepare_repair` (inputs `gap_id`, optional `snapshot_id`),
  `ripr_get_repair_attempt` (input `attempt_id`), and
  `ripr_get_receipt_status` (input `receipt_id`); resource templates
  `ripr://repair-attempt/{attempt_id}` and `ripr://receipt/{receipt_id}`.
  Tool and template names follow the registry established in #3088.
- `ripr_prepare_repair` evaluates the committed producer repair-readiness
  facts on one canonical item of the current completed snapshot. The
  evaluation is a fail-closed conjunction computed at snapshot commit time:
  candidate actionability (`#3281` predicate), an established discriminator
  (non-empty normalized discriminator, no producer-named missing
  discriminator), and an established fix site (a strong-oracle,
  high-confidence directly-related test on a shared edit-cage test-surface
  path). The first failing gate is the typed reason (`not_candidate_actionable`,
  `missing_discriminator`,
  `discriminator_not_populated_for_language`, `static_limitation`,
  `fix_site_not_established`,
  `fix_site_not_test_surface`). A producer that names its missing
  discriminators (activation `missing_discriminators`, or a
  `Missing discriminator value:` entry in `missing`) refuses as
  `missing_discriminator`. A finding whose canonical gap the producer
  withheld behind the finding's own typed static limitation refuses as
  `static_limitation` — the per-finding limitation, not the language,
  explains the missing fact (Python omits the canonical gap exactly when a
  static limit is present). A producer that names no missing discriminator
  and populates no canonical gap at all — a language producer that does not
  populate canonical gaps yet, today every Rust finding — refuses as
  `discriminator_not_populated_for_language`, naming the unpopulated
  producer condition so one document cannot contradict its own
  `discriminator_availability` block (#5268); the readiness reason and the
  `ripr_prepare_repair` ineligibility are the same evaluation.
- When every gate is established, the tool creates one session repair
  transaction with a deterministic, root-bound `repair-attempt-` identity
  (the first 24 hex digits of a SHA-256 over schema version, snapshot id,
  canonical id, and root identity), an `awaiting_edit` state, the fix-site
  bounded packet (allowed edit surface limited to the test file,
  `must_not_change` edit-cage statements, stop conditions, before-evidence
  identity, an empty `command_routes` list with the typed limitation that
  concrete `CommandSpec` routes are published only by the durable CLI
  before phase), the shared non-claims, and resource links. Repeating the
  call for the same current snapshot, item, and root returns the identical
  document and never creates a second transaction. The transaction is
  in-memory like the snapshot: a restart drops it.
- When a gate is not established, the tool returns an
  `isError: false` document with `repair_packet_ready: false`, the typed
  `ineligibility.reason`, and `attempt: null` — never a failure envelope,
  never a created attempt, never a guessed field.
- `ripr_get_repair_attempt` and the `ripr://repair-attempt/{attempt_id}`
  resource read one transaction by identity: session transactions answer
  first; otherwise the durable attempt store of this session's root is
  inventoried through the shared repair-attempt authority and a valid
  manifest projects its state, repository head, seam identity, artifact
  digest bindings, follow-up command display string, typed `CommandSpec`
  routes when the retained packet carries valid ones (each projected
  exactly, with the human display marked as never execution authority and
  `shell_required` / `manual` modes visibly non-direct), limitations,
  non-claims, and after-phase bindings. The host-local root path is
  intentionally not projected (ADR 0022 hashing posture).
- At a current HEAD, a durable attempt's `next_command` uses the shared
  application selected-attempt action behind `ripr agent status --attempt`.
  Current awaiting work retains its after continuation. A finished current
  result offers no command; failed, incomparable and open-gap work offers the
  same new before-attempt recovery as CLI. Retained packet `command_routes`
  are available only for the selected current after action, never as a
  restart authority. A restart display string is not parsed into typed
  command authority. Historical or unknown HEAD still offers no command or
  routes. Receipt classification, identity and retained bytes are unchanged.
  The restart display's executable `--root` argument preserves the selected
  filesystem path: a Unix backslash is a filename character, while Windows
  separators retain their existing normalization. Generic report/artifact
  display text must not define executable root identity. These advisory
  strings remain separate from typed `CommandSpec` execution authority.
- `ripr_get_receipt_status` and the `ripr://receipt/{receipt_id}` resource
  project the current receipt state for one attempt identity (receipt ids
  are attempt-bound). The status vocabulary is `awaiting_edit`,
  `after_pending`, `verification_pending`, `improved`, `closed`,
  `unchanged`, `regressed`, `limited`, `stale`, `invalid`; durable manifest
  states map onto it, and a finished attempt with a digest-bound terminal
  receipt projects the receipt document with its exact byte bindings. The
  terminal projection consumes the same `AgentReceiptReading` as CLI status:
  advisory plus improved static grip reports `improved`; complete unchanged
  and regressed receipts preserve their movements; complete `changed` stays
  open and reports `limited`. Producer-invalid status reports `invalid` first;
  recorded stale and gap-mismatch lifecycle states retain `stale` and `invalid`
  before other incomplete or unavailable producer completeness reports
  `limited`, even when static movement improved. Advisory regression retains
  the trimmed, case-insensitive legacy `static_movement.state` fallback after
  `provenance.movement` and before `seam.change`; it cannot bypass completeness.
  Receipt presence alone never reports `closed`;
  the declared vocabulary and schema stay unchanged. Producer completeness,
  static movement and runtime execution remain separate evidence axes. Session transactions
  report `awaiting_edit` with an explicit null receipt: RIPR performs no
  verification and issues no receipt, so the external client owns the edit,
  the verification execution, and the receipt under its own authority.
- Fail-closed states: before the first successful refresh,
  `ripr_prepare_repair` fails with `no_snapshot`; the two reads route
  through the durable store and fail with `attempt_not_found`. During an
  attempt the tools report `analysis_in_flight`. An unknown item fails with
  `item_not_found`. The supported stdio transport admits one request through
  its reply flush, so a refresh queued behind a durable read cannot begin
  during that read. The session guard is evaluated at read admission; this
  slice adds no concurrent public transport or response-time lease. An
  unknown attempt or receipt identity fails with
  `attempt_not_found`; a durable manifest that fails canonical validation
  fails with `attempt_invalid`; a session transaction bound to a snapshot
  that is no longer current fails with the reserved `superseded` state and
  the current snapshot identity. A document over the response bound fails
  with `result_too_large`. Unknown tool arguments are rejected at the
  dispatch edge with `INVALID_PARAMS`.
- `ripr_get_gap`'s readiness block now reports the committed producer
  repair-readiness facts, and a live session transaction binds the item's
  `repair_attempt` link (removing the reservation note); without a
  transaction the link stays an explicit null.

## Required Evidence

- Unit controls over session transactions: the complete ready route
  creates exactly one replay-resistant attempt; missing producer facts
  produce the honest negative document and no attempt; stale and unknown
  items fail closed; attempt identity is root-bound; a refresh that changes
  the evidence supersedes the prior transaction; session receipt status
  stays `awaiting_edit`; unknown and canonically invalid durable attempts
  fail closed in a temporary store.
- #5268 honesty controls: a finding with no canonical gap and no
  producer-named missing discriminator refuses as
  `discriminator_not_populated_for_language` in both the gap document's
  readiness block (which agrees with its own `discriminator_availability`
  block) and the negative `ripr_prepare_repair` document, while a
  producer-named missing discriminator keeps the `missing_discriminator`
  refusal and a finding whose gap the producer withheld behind its own
  typed static limitation refuses as `static_limitation`, never as a
  language-wide gap. Flipping a refusal back to a contradiction or a
  misattribution must fail these controls.
- Vocabulary and projection controls: the receipt-status mapping over the
  shared receipt reading and subordinate presence lifecycle. Producer-backed
  controls cover complete improved, changed, regressed and unchanged, typed
  incomplete improved, missing outcome improved and invalid outcome improved
  (plus the `PartialWithLimitations` typed sibling). Each case uses a fresh
  real Git fixture, actual prepare/finish and receipt binding, real produced
  verify/receipt bytes and immutable terminal retention before comparing CLI
  status with the MCP document. Actual byte hashes/sizes, repeated reads and
  intentional digest tamper are checked. These source tests do not establish
  stock-process parity or installed CLI receipt issuance; #3091 retains that
  transport acceptance. Restoring presence-only closure or dropping producer
  completeness must fail the corresponding control.
- `CommandSpec` projection round-trips direct, shell-required, and manual
  modes without granting display authority, and a removal experiment shows a
  spaced display argument cannot be reconstructed from the display string.
- Wire controls: the SDK session discovers all seven tools and four
  templates; the stdio fail-closed control pins the typed pre-refresh
  failures for the new tools; the inline-version recovery control expects
  the seven-tool surface.

## Non-Goals

- No source edit, test authoring, process launch, or verification or
  mutation command execution; the external client's approval and sandbox
  policy remains authoritative for every command a returned route names.
- No durable attempt creation: `begin_repair_attempt_with_identity` stays
  CLI-owned (`ripr agent repair --phase before`); MCP reads the durable
  store read-only and never writes it.
- No command-route reconstruction from display prose; a route that does
  not validate as a typed `CommandSpec` stays unprojected with an honest
  limitation.
- No receipt issuance; receipt state binds producer-retained bytes and is
  re-validated on every read, never joined by mtime or latest-file
  convention.
- No seam-pipeline target-admission rerun; the fix site is the strongest
  producer test grip, not an admitted seam target.
- No custom LSP request expansion; MCP and LSP remain peers over shared
  producers.
- No provider-specific configuration. The analysis configuration posture
  follows #6825 (the workspace's own `ripr.toml` is honored; provider
  configuration stays unloaded); the repair-transaction tools read the
  committed snapshot and durable store and load no configuration of
  their own.
- No support-tier promotion.

## Acceptance Examples

1. A stock MCP client refreshes, lists gaps, and calls
   `ripr_prepare_repair` for one ready item twice: both calls return the
   identical bounded packet with one `repair-attempt-` identity, an
   `awaiting_edit` state, the test-file-only allowed edit surface, empty
   `command_routes` with the typed limitation, and the resource links; the
   item's `ripr_get_gap` document now binds the same repair-attempt link.
2. The same client prepares an ineligible item (missing discriminator) and
   receives `repair_packet_ready: false`, the typed ineligibility reason,
   and `attempt: null` — with no attempt discoverable afterwards.
3. `ripr_get_repair_attempt` for a durable CLI attempt of the same root
   projects the manifest state, artifact digest bindings, and typed
   `CommandSpec` routes with `display_is_execution_authority: false`; a
   garbage manifest fails closed with `attempt_invalid`.
4. `ripr_get_receipt_status` for a finished durable attempt with a retained
   terminal receipt projects a status no stronger than the shared producer
   reading, with the receipt's exact byte bindings: complete improved stays
   `improved`, complete changed stays open as `limited`, and incomplete or
   invalid completeness cannot claim improvement. Static movement stays in
   the original producer document. A session transaction reports
   `awaiting_edit` with an explicit null receipt.
5. Before any refresh, `ripr_prepare_repair` fails closed with
   `no_snapshot` and the two reads fail closed with `attempt_not_found`; a
   refresh that changes the evidence fails an old transaction with the
   reserved `superseded` state and the current snapshot identity.
6. Durable reads share CLI's read-time HEAD applicability, independently of
   retained byte authentication and recorded after admission. An ordinary
   awaiting attempt remains current on a descendant; a diverged or unreadable
   HEAD suppresses stored continuation and typed routes. A finished attempt
   uses its exact after HEAD, so a later descendant is historical. Both
   documents expose `currentness.state`, `head_current` and `evidence_head`;
   recorded `after_current` remains separate. Historical/unknown applicability
   weakens otherwise actionable receipt status to `stale`/`limited` while
   retaining its document; invalid/limited producer results stay non-success.
   This checks HEAD applicability, not dirty-byte identity. Reads never alter
   the manifest or reconstruct evidence from a compatibility receipt.
   Session transactions and tombstones resolve immediately under the lock;
   only independent durable fallback runs on a blocking worker outside it.
   Timers/teardown must not run synchronous Git on the async executor. This
   adds no new stdio concurrency or early Git cancellation guarantee.

## Test Mapping

- `crates/ripr/src/mcp/repair.rs::tests` — session transaction route,
  ineligibility, fail-closed states, root-bound identity, supersession,
  receipt status, durable-store negatives, vocabulary mapping, and
  `CommandSpec` projection experiments. #5199 gives every semantic fixture
  one independently selectable owner over the same actual producer/retention
  route: `complete_improved_receipt_preserves_improvement`,
  `complete_changed_receipt_never_closes_the_gap`,
  `typed_incomplete_receipt_never_claims_improvement`,
  `partial_incomplete_receipt_never_claims_improvement`,
  `missing_outcome_receipt_never_claims_improvement`,
  `invalid_outcome_receipt_preserves_invalid_status`,
  `complete_unchanged_receipt_preserves_unchanged_status` and the existing
  `regressed_movement_survives_the_presence_lifecycle`. A failing case cannot
  prevent another case's exact test selector from running.
  Literal adapter controls
  `terminal_receipts_preserve_stale_and_mismatch_before_completeness` and
  `terminal_legacy_regression_preserves_completeness_and_field_precedence`
  separately pin lifecycle specificity, producer-invalid precedence,
  legacy normalization and field priority, incomplete/missing-status guards,
  and near-token refusal. They do not establish producer or retention
  authenticity for those compatibility inputs.
- `crates/ripr/src/mcp/gaps.rs::tests` — the committed producer
  repair-readiness evaluation and its fail-closed gates.
- `crates/ripr/src/mcp/protocol.rs::tests` + `server_tests.rs` —
  descriptors, vocabulary, instructions, dispatch-edge rejections, and
  pre-refresh typed failures.
- `crates/ripr/tests/mcp_sdk.rs`, `crates/ripr/tests/mcp_stdio.rs` —
  hosted wire interop controls.
