# RIPR-SPEC-0031: Lane 1 Evidence Quality Audit

Status: proposed

## Problem

Lane 1 has a stable `evidence_record` spine. The next risk is evidence quality:
RIPR can still overcount equivalent gaps, rank weak related tests too highly,
leave candidate values sparse, explain oracle semantics unevenly, or report
uncalibrated classes without enough visibility.

Before changing analyzer heuristics, maintainers need a repo-local audit that
measures those gaps from the existing repo exposure artifact.

## Product Contract

`cargo xtask lane1-evidence-audit` is an advisory repo-local report over
`seams[].evidence_record` data generated from repo exposure.

The command:

- generates repo exposure through the existing `ripr check --mode instant
  --format repo-exposure-json` path;
- streams repo-exposure latency trace lines while the generated repo exposure
  subprocess runs so long live audits show bounded progress instead of silent
  waiting;
- streams `seams[].evidence_record` from the generated repo exposure JSON so
  the audit does not need to retain the full repo-exposure artifact in memory;
- records bounded repo-exposure generation diagnostics in the audit input block,
  including timeout, status, duration, output byte counts, and the tail of the
  latency trace;
- emits named run limitations when repo-exposure generation is too slow or
  pathological instead of silently dropping evidence or waiting forever;
- writes deterministic JSON and Markdown reports under `target/ripr/reports`;
- summarizes evidence quality without changing classifications;
- does not alter gates, PR/CI projection, editor behavior, schemas outside this
  report, source files, baselines, or generated workflows;
- does not run mutation execution.

`cargo xtask evidence-quality-audit` is a compatibility alias for the same
repo-local report.

## Behavior

```text
cargo xtask lane1-evidence-audit
```

The command writes:

```text
target/ripr/reports/lane1-evidence-audit.json
target/ripr/reports/lane1-evidence-audit.md
target/ripr/reports/actionable-gaps.json
target/ripr/reports/actionable-gaps.md
```

It exits successfully after both artifacts are written. If repo exposure
generation exits non-zero after writing a complete repo-exposure JSON document
with a top-level `seams` array, the audit may continue from that captured
artifact with a warning. If repo exposure generation times out before a
complete artifact exists, the command writes bounded warning artifacts with a
`lane1_repo_exposure_timeout` run limitation, phase/input context, the latency
trace tail, and a repair route. If repo exposure generation exits before the
captured artifact is complete, including a nominally successful exit that left
an empty or malformed output file, the command writes bounded warning artifacts
with a `lane1_repo_exposure_incomplete` run limitation instead of failing before
the report surfaces the phase/input diagnostics.

## JSON Contract

The JSON shape is defined in
[OUTPUT_SCHEMA.md](../OUTPUT_SCHEMA.md#lane-1-evidence-quality-audit). It
includes:

- `schema_version`;
- `tool`;
- `report`;
- `scope`;
- `status`;
- `inputs`;
- `run_limitations`;
- `summary`;
- `finding_alignment`;
- `finding_alignment.actionable_gap_packets`;
- `finding_alignment.runtime_confidence_by_class`;
- standalone `actionable-gaps` packet projection;
- `canonical_gap_groups`;
- `duplicate_looking_groups`;
- `missing_discriminator_classes`;
- `static_limitations`;
- `oracle_semantics_distribution`;
- `related_test_ranking`;
- `movement_availability`;
- `calibration_availability`;
- `evidence_record_field_health`;
- `top_files_by_unresolved_evidence_debt`.

`finding_alignment.actionable_gap_top_lists` is derived from canonical items,
not raw findings. It reports bounded `{label, count}` rows for actionable gap
classes, files, repair kinds, missing discriminator kinds, static limitation
reasons on actionable gap records, verify-command unknowns, and repair-route
unknowns. These rows are advisory triage hints for the next fixture-backed Lane
1 repair slice.

The report is additive and repo-local. It is not a replacement for
`repo-exposure.json`, `evidence-health.json`, or calibration reports.

## Markdown Contract

The Markdown sibling prints the same audit areas in bounded tables:

- repo-exposure generation diagnostics;
- summary;
- finding alignment;
- runtime confidence coverage by evidence class;
- actionable canonical gap top lists;
- largest canonical gap groups;
- duplicate-looking groups;
- missing discriminator classes;
- static limitations;
- oracle semantics;
- related-test ranking;
- movement availability;
- calibration availability;
- evidence record field health;
- top files by unresolved evidence debt.

High-cardinality count maps remain complete in JSON and are capped in Markdown.
Free-form text counts for missing-discriminator reasons and values,
static-limitation reasons, and oracle-semantics strings are emitted as complete
`{label, count}` rows, not object keys, so case-only variants remain distinct
for case-insensitive JSON consumers such as Windows PowerShell.

## Required Evidence

The audit must summarize:

- raw headline gaps;
- finding-alignment raw signals, canonical items, actionability states, and
  raw-to-canonical counts derived from `evidence_record.canonical_item`;
- finding-alignment coverage by evidence class, unaligned raw finding examples,
  same-line duplicate groups, static-unknown items without named limitations,
  and canonical items missing repair or verification guidance;
- actionable canonical gap top lists for class, file, repair kind, missing
  discriminator kind, static limitation reason on actionable gap records,
  verify-command unknown, and repair-route unknown counts;
- canonical gap groups;
- largest canonical groups;
- duplicate-looking groups;
- missing discriminator classes;
- static limitations by reason, stage, normalized category, and repair route;
- oracle semantics distribution;
- related-test ranking confidence;
- movement availability fields;
- calibration availability;
- runtime confidence coverage by canonical evidence class;
- calibrated versus uncalibrated records;
- `evidence_record` missing, nullable, or empty fields;
- top files by unresolved evidence debt.

## Acceptance Examples

Given two headline seams with the same canonical gap ID, the audit reports one
canonical group and lists that group as duplicate-looking.

Given evidence records that carry `canonical_item`, the audit reports a
`finding_alignment.summary` so the scorecard can count canonical items,
actionable items, observed items, static limitations, calibration support, and
raw-to-canonical alignment without requiring a separate top-level projection.

Given actionable canonical items with structured repair routes and verify
commands, the audit reports top actionable classes, files, repair kinds, and
missing discriminator kinds while preserving raw findings as supporting
evidence only.

Given actionable canonical items missing a structured repair route or verify
command, the audit increments the existing coverage counters and lists the
affected evidence classes in `top_repair_route_unknowns` or
`top_verify_command_unknowns`.

Given canonical items with confidence basis data, the audit reports
`finding_alignment.runtime_confidence_by_class` and mirrors those rows under
`calibration_availability.runtime_confidence_by_class`. Rows are keyed by
`canonical_item.evidence_class` and count calibrated-supported, fixture-backed,
static-only, unknown-confidence, uncalibrated, actionable, and limitation items
without changing static classifications or running mutation testing.

Given evidence records with and without `canonical_item`, the audit reports
`finding_alignment.coverage` so maintainers can see which evidence classes are
aligned, which raw findings remain unaligned, whether duplicate raw findings
share a file and line, and whether canonical items lack repair routes,
verification commands, or named static-limitation categories.

Given a static-unknown or limitation-shaped canonical item, a limitation is
named only when it carries a non-generic category and repair route. Generic
`static_unknown` or `unknown` categories remain counted under
`static_unknown_without_named_limitation` so unknowns stay visible as analyzer
work instead of becoming vague user test debt.

Given a long-running repo-wide audit, the command prints latency-trace progress
from the repo-exposure subprocess and records the bounded diagnostics in
`inputs.repo_exposure_generation`. If generation times out before a complete
repo-exposure JSON document exists, the audit still writes a limited artifact
with `run_limitations[].category = "lane1_repo_exposure_timeout"`,
`phase = "repo_exposure_generation"`, phase/input diagnostics, the most recent
latency trace entries, and a repair route. Downstream scorecards must surface
that limitation and must not treat zero counts in the limited artifact as proof
that no gaps exist.
Best-effort cache writes are not allowed to turn a completed analysis into an
unbounded wait: large classified-seam cache entries may be skipped when the
trace records a `cache_store` status such as
`ignored_skipped_large_entry_seams_..._limit_...`.

Given a repo-exposure subprocess that exits successfully but leaves an empty,
malformed, or otherwise incomplete captured JSON artifact, the audit treats that
as `lane1_repo_exposure_incomplete`, preserves the subprocess diagnostics and
latency trace tail, removes the partial input, and does not claim complete repo
truth or user test debt from the limited artifact.

Given a headline seam with no canonical gap ID, the audit counts it under
`headline_without_canonical_gap_id`.

Given missing discriminators, static limitations, low-confidence top related
tests, or no related tests, the audit increments the matching distributions and
file-debt rows. Static limitations are grouped by normalized analyzer category
and repair route without treating those categories as user-actionable test
gaps.

Given records with `calibration.availability = "not_imported"`, the audit counts
them as uncalibrated. Imported availability counts as calibrated scope for this
audit report only; it does not change static classifications.

Given actionable canonical items with structured repair routes and verify
commands, the audit emits bounded actionable-gap packets in the audit JSON and
the standalone `target/ripr/reports/actionable-gaps.{json,md}` artifacts. Each
packet is one canonical item, preserves raw findings as supporting evidence,
includes repair and verification guidance, and carries conservative
`must_not_change` boundaries. It does not fan raw findings back out into
separate user work.
