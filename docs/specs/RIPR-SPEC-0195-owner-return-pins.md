- #4478 (confirm a return value pinned by `assert_eq!` on the owner's own call)
- #3727 (parser-backed call identity; this spec adds the owner's item
  container fact, not parser-derived `CallFact`)

Support-tier impact:

- No tier change. A Rust `return_value` finding can now read `exposed`
  when a related test pins the owner's whole return value through a call
  that names the owner. No new language or surface is claimed.

Policy impact:

- None. No new gate, policy surface, or allowlist entry.

## Problem

A Rust `return_value` probe confirms its discriminator only when an
assertion shares an identifier token with the changed expression. A test
that pins the owner's exact return value through a call of the owner shares
no such token. The OSS replay of tokio-rs/bytes 7930d93 changed
`Buf::try_get_int`'s tail to `Ok(sign_extend(self.try_get_uint(nbytes)?, nbytes))`.
The commit's own test `assert_eq!(a.try_get_int(3), Ok(-1))` kills every
mutant of that line, and ripr reported `weakly_exposed` with "Discriminator
unconfirmed".

A lexical "the assertion calls something named like the owner" rule is
wrong in three shapes, each of which an earlier candidate credited:

1. An associated function `T::name` next to a same-named free function
   `name`: a bare `name(..)` in a test names the free function.
2. A trait default method whose receiver's impl overrides it: the call runs
   the override, not the default.
3. An input that leaves the owner through another return path: with
   `Ok(g(x)? * 2)` changed, `assert_eq!(f(-1), Err(E))` observes the `?`
   exit and never evaluates the changed `Ok(..)`.

## Behavior

An `assert_eq!` confirms a `return_value` probe's discriminator when all of
the following hold. Each rule fails closed: when ripr cannot establish it,
the assertion keeps today's token rule.

1. Oracle shape. The assertion is one plain `assert_eq!` (never
   `assert_ne!`, `debug_assert_eq!`, a path-qualified or crate-specific
   `*_assert_eq!`) with an exact-value or whole-object oracle kind, on a line
   inside the test's own body, in a test without `#[should_panic]`. Exactly
   one compared operand is a complete call of the owner's name with nothing
   chained after it, and the other operand does not mention the owner's
   name (`assert_eq!(f(4), f(2) + f(2))` compares the owner with itself).
2. Call identity, from the parser's item-container fact on the owner
   (`FunctionFact.item`: free, local, inherent, trait impl, or trait, with
   the `self`-receiver and body flags; the lexical fallback leaves it
   unknown):
   - A bare `name(..)` names only a module-level function without a `self`
     receiver. No other module-level function of that name may exist in the
     workspace, the test must not bind the name (`let`, nested `fn`, the
     test's parameters, a `for`, closure or match-arm pattern, or a macro
     such as `let_assert!` that mentions it), and the test's file must not
     rename an item to it (`use a::b as name`).
   - A method call `recv.name(..)` names only a function with a `self`
     receiver in an `impl` or `trait` block. `recv` must be a plain local
     binding, and every `let` that binds it must be a simple
     `let [mut] recv [: T] = ..;` whose type ripr can read: an annotation,
     a struct or tuple literal (`T { .. }`, `T(..)`), or a constructor call
     whose signature returns the type: `T::default()` and `T::from(..)`
     directly, `T::try_from(..)` only after `?`, `.unwrap()` or
     `.expect(..)`, and any other `T::f(..)` only when `f` is `T`'s one
     inherent associated function of that name and declares `-> Self` (or
     `-> T`), or `Result`/`Option` of it followed by `?`, `.unwrap()` or
     `.expect(..)`; or a byte-slice expression (`&[..][..]`, `&b".."[..]`).
     A name bound by any other pattern (a closure parameter, a `for` or
     match-arm pattern, a destructuring `let`, a nested `fn`, the test's
     parameters, a macro that mentions it) leaves the type unestablished. A
     named type must be a struct, enum or union declared in the workspace,
     and the test's file must not import it from outside the workspace,
     rename another item to it, or declare a `type` alias of it.
   - The receiver type must dispatch to the owner: the inherent `impl`'s
     self type, the trait impl's self type, or, for a trait default method,
     a type with an `impl .. Trait for <type>` in the workspace. A trait
     method also needs its trait in scope: the test's file imports it by
     name from a workspace path (`crate`, `self`, `super`, a workspace
     package, or its `::`-rooted form), or declares it. A byte-slice
     receiver never credits a name `&[u8]` itself resolves (slice methods,
     prelude and `std::io` trait methods). A named receiver never credits
     a by-value prelude trait method name (`count`, `map`, `into`, ...):
     method lookup tries `T` before `&T`, so `Iterator::count(self)` takes
     `c.count()` before an inherent `count(&self)` whenever the type is an
     iterator, and ripr cannot see which std traits a type implements.
   - No other workspace definition of the name with a `self` receiver and a
     body may exist (an override, another type's inherent method, another
     trait's method), except a pure `(**self).name(..)` / `(*self).name(..)`
     forward. A definition the parser did not index (a `macro_rules!` body)
     counts when its `fn name` text is visible. A definition in a
     lexical-fallback file always counts.
3. Return path. The changed expression must be the owner body's tail (or
   its final `return <expr>;`), and it must evaluate all of its parts on
   every input: no closure or `|` operator, no `&&`/`||`, no `if`, `match`,
   loop or `break`, and no combinator that skips its argument on some
   inputs (`map_or`, `unwrap_or`, `and_then`, `then`, ...). With
   `x.map_or(0, |v| v * 3)` changed, `assert_eq!(f(None), 0)` never runs
   the changed closure. When the owner has no `?` and no other
   `return`, any pinned value came through it. Otherwise the changed
   expression must be one `Ok(..)` (or `Some(..)`) constructor, the only
   one in the body, every other `return` must build `Err(..)` (or `None`),
   and the pinned value must itself be `Ok(..)` (or `Some(..)`). An owner
   body that invokes any macro outside a fixed non-returning set
   (`assert!`, `format!`, `panic!`, `vec!`, ...), however it is spaced
   (`ensure !(..)`), leaves the return paths unestablished.
4. The existing owner-binding defeats still apply: a foreign same-name
   import, a same-named function in the test's own package when the owner
   lives in another package, and the exact variant when the changed
   expression constructs an error variant.

## Required Evidence

- The bytes 7930d93 replay moves both `return_value` findings
  (`try_get_int`, `try_get_int_le`) from `weakly_exposed` to `exposed`, and
  the commit's `Err(TryGetError { .. })` assertion is not the confirming
  oracle.
- A fixture pins the bytes shape (`fixtures/owner_return_pin_trait_method`).
- A fixture pins each trap as non-exposed
  (`fixtures/owner_return_pin_identity_traps`): the associated-versus-free
  bare call, the overridden trait default, the early-exit input, and the
  test-local binding of the owner's name.
- Unit tests pin every gate with a positive and a discriminating negative.

## Non-Goals

- Name resolution or type inference. The receiver typing reads a binding's
  syntax only; a receiver returned by an arbitrary function call stays
  unestablished.
- Methods generated by derive or attribute macros, and `macro_rules!`
  bodies that build the name from fragments (`paste!`), are invisible; they
  are documented residuals.
- A trait from outside the workspace that is also in scope and also names
  the method is not detected.
- Qualified calls (`Type::name(..)`, `Trait::name(&mut recv, ..)`) do not
  pin yet.
- A helper function the changed tail calls may itself ignore an argument
  on some inputs; the tail gate reads the tail's own syntax only.
- No runtime claim: `exposed` stays a static reading.

## Acceptance Examples

- Given a trait default `try_get_int` whose changed tail is
  `Ok(sign_extend(self.try_get_uint(nbytes)?, nbytes))`, an
  `impl Buf for &[u8]`, and a test importing `Buf` that binds
  `let mut a = &[0xff, 0xff, 0xff][..];` and asserts
  `assert_eq!(a.try_get_int(3), Ok(-1))`, when `ripr check` runs, then the
  finding reads `exposed`.
- Given the same owner and a test asserting only
  `assert_eq!(short.try_get_int(4), Err(TryGetError { .. }))`, the finding
  stays below `exposed`.
- Given `impl Codec { fn decode(input: u32) -> u32 }` and a free
  `fn decode`, a test asserting `assert_eq!(decode(8), 9)` does not confirm
  a change to `Codec::decode`.
- Given a trait default `next_word` and `impl Reader for Fixed` overriding
  it, a test asserting `assert_eq!(reader.next_word(), 7)` on a `Fixed`
  receiver does not confirm a change to the default.

## Test Mapping

- Unit (`crates/ripr/src/analysis/classify/owner_pin/tests.rs`): the bytes
  shape; trait scope; competing definitions (override, inherent twin,
  `macro_rules!` body, forward, free twin); receiver typing; slice-method
  names; inherent receivers; bare calls (associated twin, free twin, local
  binding, `for`/closure/parameter/macro bindings, `use .. as` renames);
  the return-path gate, including conditionally evaluated tails and spaced
  macros; plain `assert_eq!` against an owner-free value, `#[should_panic]`
  and assertions outside the test body; by-value prelude method names;
  constructor signatures; macro-bound, aliased and parameter receivers;
  lexical fallback; the item-container fact.
- Fixtures: `fixtures/owner_return_pin_trait_method`,
  `fixtures/owner_return_pin_identity_traps`; re-blessed
  `fixtures/infect_value_returned`, `fixtures/infect_wildcard_discard`,
  `fixtures/tail_comparison_boundary`, whose tests pin a free owner's
  unconditional tail.

## Implementation Mapping

- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/syntax/ra.rs`: `function_item_fact` fills
  `FunctionFact.item`.
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/facts/model.rs`: `FunctionContainer`,
  `FunctionItemFact`.
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/classify/owner_pin.rs`: `OwnerReturnPin`
  (`establish` for the owner-side gates, `admits` for the test-side gates).
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/classify/reveal.rs`: the pin joins the
  confirmation signals behind the family, oracle-kind and owner-binding
  defeats; `file_imports_own_item`; `::`-rooted `use` paths.
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/classifier/evidence.rs`: establishes the pin
  once per probe.
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/seam_cache.rs`: file-fact `1.11`, classified
  `1.17`, sharded `0.23`, compact `0.24`.

## Metrics

- `owner_return_pin_false_exposed` — zero: no fixture or replay finding
  gains `exposed` through the pin unless its confirming assertion is a
  complete call that names the owner on the changed return path.
