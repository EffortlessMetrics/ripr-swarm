Support-tier impact:

- No tier change. The admit widens which captured tests are reported as
  related evidence for an already-analyzed probe; it adds no runtime
  evidence, no harness execution, and no new analysis surface.
  [docs/status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md](../status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md) remains the
  tier authority.

## Problem

The #2971 rule filters cross-crate tests whose bare call matches an owner
name that is ambiguous across crates, because name similarity alone cannot
establish identity — that is the token-coincidence false-`related` family.
The filter is correct, but it also discards genuine evidence: in the
standard workspace layout, `crate_c`'s integration tests exercise
`crate_a`'s API through a declared path dependency, and changing `crate_a`
reports no related test even though a strong oracle exists one crate over.

The captured path-dependency graph (#2665 slices A/B) carries exactly the
missing identity evidence: which packages the calling test's package can
name imports from, under which declared dependency name, in which Cargo
section.

## Behavior

When a probe's owner name is ambiguous across crates, a cross-crate test
may be admitted as related evidence only if every boundary below holds;
each boundary fails closed (under-emit is the contract for relation
credit):

- the `calls_owner` strong signal stays mandatory; an edge never admits on
  name or token similarity alone, and no other weak signal can ride
  through it;
- the workspace index must be complete (the same precondition as the
  #2971 uniqueness bypass) and the path-dependency adjacency must report
  a `Complete` capture: `limited` (partial edge inventory) and
  `unavailable` admit nothing, never a blanket admit;
- the calling test's file and the owner's file must attribute to their
  nearest discovered manifest directory (the longest-prefix rule over the
  shared manifest inventory), and an unattributable side admits nothing;
  nested packages resolve to the nested manifest, not the first `crates/`
  segment;
- no same-named definition may be attributed to the calling test's own
  package (a local shadow), no second same-named definition may itself be
  callable from the test's package through a captured callable edge (a
  competing candidate), and an unattributable same-named definition is
  never refutable;
- exactly one direct forward declaration from the test's manifest to the
  owner's manifest participates, in a callable section: normal or dev
  dependencies (dev dependencies are callable from the declaring
  package's test targets). Reverse edges and build-only edges admit
  nothing — a bare call binds only names the declaring crate's own
  dependency declarations provide;
- call identity comes from the parser-backed captured `calls` facts only:
  a `score(` occurrence inside a comment or a string literal fabricates
  no call, and a call the extractor could not capture stays unadmitted.
  A method-shaped call (`receiver.owner(`) resolves on the receiver's
  type, not the calling crate's scope, and admits nothing;
- the captured call must be attributable to the admitted dependency: a
  call qualified through the edge's declared dependency name
  (`dependency_name::owner(`) admits without an import; otherwise a bare
  call admits only when the comment- and string-stripped **file source**
  imports the owner from that dependency name at file level (`use
  dependency_name::...owner;`, nested paths and brace lists naming the
  owner as a whole item). Imports inside nested modules are invisible to
  tests outside them and are not credited. Aliased (`as`) and glob (`*`)
  imports are refused, brace shapes the conservative parser cannot read
  fail closed, and an import naming a different dependency defeats the
  admit;
- a `let` binding of the owner name in the test body (invisible to the
  function index) defeats a bare-call admit.

Type-path calls (#4558). A captured call spelled `T::owner(` (or
`dependency_name::T::owner(`) where `T` is the owner's impl self type
admits through the same edge, graph and attribution boundaries, with its
own competitor rule instead of the local-shadow and competing-candidate
rules above:

- the owner must be a parser-backed method of an impl whose self type is
  a plain named path ending in `T` (not a generic parameter, reference or
  trait object); lexical-fallback owners never take this route;
- `T` must be imported at file level from the edge's declared dependency
  name (`use dependency_name::...::T;`), or the call spelled through it;
  renamed and glob imports do not count, and a declared name with `-`
  matches its `_` spelling;
- the type path is read from the comment- and string-masked call line, so
  a quoted `T::owner()` beside a real same-named call is not the call;
- every other same-named definition that a `T::owner(` call could reach
  refuses: a method of another impl of a type named `T`, a trait default
  method, a blanket or non-path impl, and any lexical-fallback
  definition. Free functions (module-level, or local to a function, block,
  const or static) and methods of other types cannot be the target and do
  not compete;
- the owner's crate must not bring a type named `T` in from another crate,
  or glob-import another crate, in its library source: then
  `dependency_name::...::T` may name that type, and no re-export is
  resolved here;
- a `let` binding of the owner name cannot shadow `T::owner(` and does not
  defeat this route.

Everything else about relation reporting — the reason/confidence tags,
ordering, and the shared rendering surfaces — is unchanged.

## Non-Goals

No transitive reach: a dependency-of-a-dependency never admits. No
weakening of the #2971 uniqueness bypass or the same-package prefix
guard. No mutation execution, no coverage claims, and no vocabulary
beyond the static finding contract. No corpus or golden re-bless is
implied by the admit alone: goldens change only when a fixture genuinely
pairs an ambiguous cross-crate owner with an import-evidenced dependent
call.

## Required Evidence

- a positive per callable section: a normal-dependency admit and a
  dev-dependency admit, each with the `use` import present;
- a positive for the qualified-call form admitting with no import;
- positives for the nested `use` path and the brace-list import;
- negative controls proving each boundary: reverse edge, build-only
  edge, no edge to the owner's crate, nested wrong-owner identity,
  import from a different dependency, aliased import, local `let`
  binding, method-only call form, comment-only call occurrence,
  string-literal-only call occurrence, competing edge-connected
  candidate, local same-named shadow, unattributable same-named
  definition, `limited` graph, and `unavailable` graph;
- unchanged pins for the #2971 rule: the same-package collision filter,
  the unique-owner cross-crate retention, and the incomplete-index
  fail-closed behavior.

## Acceptance Examples

- `crate_a` and `crate_b` both define `score`; `crate_c` declares
  `crate_a = { path = "../crate_a" }` and its test says
  `use crate_a::score; score(7)`: a probe on `crate_a::score` reports
  the `crate_c` test as related evidence; the same probe on
  `crate_b::score` does not.
- The same `crate_c` test importing `other_dep::score` instead: neither
  owner is credited.
- The same shape with `score(7)` appearing only in a `//` comment or a
  string literal: not admitted, even with the import present.
- Owner in the nested package `crates/outer/inner`, `crate_c` depending
  only on `outer`: not admitted; an edge to `inner` admits.
- A workspace with no captured edge between the packages, or a graph
  that is `limited` or `unavailable`: the #2971 filter stands.
- tracing: `tracing-core` changes `impl LevelFilter { fn current() }`;
  a `tracing-subscriber` test with `use tracing_core::LevelFilter;` asserts
  `LevelFilter::current()`. `tracing-subscriber` defines its own
  `SpanStack::current`, which cannot be the target, so the test relates.
  The original test imports `tracing_subscriber::filter::LevelFilter`, a
  re-export, and stays unrelated.
