- [#4796](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/ripr-swarm/issues/4796) implements the feedback ledger
- [#3806](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/ripr-swarm/issues/3806) supplies immutable terminal judgments
- [#4795](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/ripr-swarm/issues/4795) owns runtime calibration and is not absorbed
- [#3164](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/ripr-swarm/issues/3164) remains the parent programme

Support-tier impact:

- None. The ledger is a metrics sidecar. Support-tier and capability checks
  must not consume it more strongly than its judged denominator.
  [docs/status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md](../status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md)

Policy impact:

- Register this spec in `policy/doc-artifacts.toml` and
  `.ripr/traceability.toml`.
- Retain `metrics/rust-judged-behavior-panel/feedback-ledger.json` under the
  existing judged-panel JSON allowlist.
- No analyzer, GitHub, calibration, support, or release mutation.

## Problem

Independently adjudicated Rust failures were not durable, owned, or
regression-tracked. Confirmed false-exposed, false-actionable, under-credit,
wrong-target, and incorrect-limitation families could disappear after a later
repair, or be forced into the wrong defect class by nearby targets, human
prose, or runtime calibration.

## Behavior

`cargo xtask rust-judged-panel check` validates one retained feedback ledger
bound to the #3806 judgment packet by digest. Every terminal judged case has
exactly one row. Failure direction is derived from immutable labels:

```text
false_exposed
false_actionable
incorrect_limitation
static_under_credit
wrong_target (only when no stronger label fires and an exact target is bound)
inconclusive_no_feedback
instrument_or_case_defect
no_confirmed_failure
```

Closed repair states are `open`, `candidate_in_review`,
`repaired_pending_replay`, and `closed_with_replay`. Closure requires a merged
implementation identity and original-case replay. A fixture pass without that
replay stays `repaired_pending_replay`. Wrong-target closure cannot succeed on
a nearby observer identity.

Confirmed defects that cannot retain the exact mechanism as a producer-path
honesty fixture stay `replay_only` with a named materialization or
authorization boundary. The ledger records owner-search receipts and reuses a
focused owner when one exists. It does not create, assign, close, or label
GitHub objects.

`cargo xtask rust-judged-panel feedback [--out] [--check]` derives JSON and
Markdown from one DTO. Reports carry counts by direction, status, reduction,
and owner class. They carry no overall analyzer score. Runtime calibration
status is `#4795` metadata (`not_run` while that producer's release-challenge
receipts stay unauthorized) and cannot set the static class.

## Non-Goals

- Analyzer family repairs
- Automatic GitHub issue or PR mutation
- Judgment or runtime-result rewrite
- #4795 calibration execution or scorecard
- #3164 parent closure, support promotion, or release membership
- Route-yield denominator merger with #3076
- Honesty-corpus writes from this command

## Required Evidence

- Discriminating tests named `rust_analysis_feedback_*` cover false-exposed vs
  false-actionable, under-credit vs support promotion, wrong-target identity,
  limitation/inconclusive non-defects, duplicate and existing-owner reuse,
  extra or missing rows, anti-hardcode fixture ids, repaired-without-replay,
  stale digest, row-order stability, denominator change on deletion, human
  notes that cannot strengthen a class, and calibration that cannot set the
  static class.
- Production `feedback-ledger.json` validates against the current #3806
  packet.
- JSON and Markdown reports agree on every count, including family and owner
  denominators.

## Inputs

- `metrics/rust-judged-behavior-panel/release-judgments.json`
- `metrics/rust-judged-behavior-panel/feedback-ledger.json`

## Outputs

- Validation on `cargo xtask rust-judged-panel check`
- `target/ripr/rust-judged-panel/feedback/feedback.json`
- `target/ripr/rust-judged-panel/feedback/feedback.md`

## Acceptance Examples

1. A confirmed false-exposed row cannot be classified false-actionable.
2. Closing a repaired row without original-case replay is rejected.
3. Reordered ledger rows emit byte-identical reports.
4. Deleting one unfavorable row changes the defect denominator.
5. Notes claiming false-exposed cannot reclassify an inconclusive judgment.
