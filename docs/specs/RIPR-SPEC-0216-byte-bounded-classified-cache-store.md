# RIPR-SPEC-0216: Byte-bounded classified-cache store publication

Status: proposed

Owner: product-analysis

Created: 2026-10-03

Linked issues: #4999 (write-side store amplification; sibling load bound is #5124)

Support-tier impact:

- None. This is an internal cache-publication bound. It does not change
  analysis classes, public JSON findings, or support claims.
  [docs/status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md](../status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md)

Policy impact: none. No new process, network, or file-policy surface. The new
env var is a store-path ceiling, not a process-RSS or load bound.

## Problem

Classified-seam cache publication still selected the single-entry versus
sharded path from record count alone. Both paths then deep-cloned the
chosen `ClassifiedSeam` slice and materialized the complete pretty-encoded
body as a `Vec<u8>` before the atomic write. A record count that is safe
for small records can still produce a multi-hundred-megabyte transient
shard. Historical host evidence around #4291 recorded an approximately
5.2 GB classified cache and an OOM during `cache_store` at roughly
11.7 GB anonymous RSS; that motivates a bounded store path without
proving a universal RSS threshold.

## Behavior

- Ordinary classified-cache publication serializes borrowed
  `ClassifiedSeam` records. It does not build `chunk.to_vec()`,
  `seams.to_vec()`, or an equivalent deep-cloned shard payload.
- Encoding writes through a bounded IO buffer into the existing atomic
  temporary-file protocol. The store path does not retain the complete
  encoded entry or shard as a `Vec<u8>`.
- The primary shard/single-entry bound is encoded bytes:
  `RIPR_CLASSIFIED_SEAM_CACHE_SHARD_BYTES` (default 8 MiB,
  `CLASSIFIED_SEAM_CACHE_ENCODED_SHARD_CEILING_BYTES`). Record count
  (`RIPR_REPO_SEAM_CACHE_LIMIT` / `RIPR_COMPACT_REPO_SEAM_CACHE_MAX_SEAMS`)
  remains a secondary cap, not the sole selector.
- A payload may still be written as one file when it fits both the byte
  ceiling and the record cap. Otherwise it is published as byte-bounded
  shards. Manifest admission remains the generation gate: replacement
  shards use a new generation path so a failed publication leaves the
  previous valid generation or a miss, never a mixed authoritative
  manifest. An unpublished generation directory is removed on those
  failure paths. A prior single entry is parked off the loader's
  preferred path until the new manifest is admitted, then removed; a
  pre-commit failure restores it only when no newer single entry or
  sharded manifest occupies the loader-visible paths.
- If one classified seam cannot fit under the configured byte ceiling,
  the store returns `skipped_oversized_record_index_{i}_ceiling_{n}` and
  does not claim a populated cache. Analysis output stays usable.
- Semantic digests, schema/analyzer identity, shard order, checksums,
  corruption handling, and warm-load reconstruction stay the current
  contracts. This spec does not bound cache *load* auxiliary memory.

## Non-Goals

- No redesign of cache load, lazy paging, or the final
  `Vec<ClassifiedSeam>` consumer API (#5124).
- No change to classification semantics or truncation of valid analysis
  output.
- No mmap requirement, process-RSS guarantee, or release operation.
- No weakening of checksum, digest, schema, or atomic-publication
  integrity.

## Required Evidence

- Owned versus borrowed streaming encodes are byte-identical for single
  entries and shards.
- Variable-size records with a record cap that would keep one entry still
  split when the encoded-byte ceiling requires it.
- Below-limit, exactly-at-limit, and one-byte-over single-record cases.
- Empty cache, many small records, and multi-shard round-trips preserve
  semantic order.
- Zero `ClassifiedSeam` clones and zero complete encoded `Vec<u8>` on the
  ordinary store path; IO high-water stays within the bounded buffer
  while the published file exceeds that buffer.
- One oversized record skips without publishing a generation.
- Failed replacement and cancellation leave the previous generation and
  do not retain an extra unpublished `g*` directory.
- A failed sharded replacement of a single entry restores that entry;
  a successful replacement leaves no preferred single path.
- Rollback restore does not replace a newer single entry or hide a
  newer sharded manifest published after parking.
- Size probes stop once encoded bytes exceed the ceiling; a large record
  cap still splits on the byte bound without serializing a full
  record-limit window.
- Shard relative paths reject parent, separator, and drive-prefixed
  components.
- Injected fill failure, mid-generation failure, and cancellation leave
  the previous valid generation.
- Existing integrity, missing-shard, and warm-hit controls keep passing.

## Acceptance Examples

- Two tiny records plus one medium record with record cap 8 and a byte
  ceiling equal to one medium shard publish multiple shards, not one
  count-sized entry.
- A single record whose encoded size equals the ceiling publishes as
  `ok`; one byte less skips without replacing a prior valid entry.
- Replacing a valid sharded generation and failing before the new
  manifest keeps the prior warm hit.

## Implementation Mapping

- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/seam_cache/store.rs` — publication planner,
  borrowed envelopes, bounded writer, generation-atomic shard names
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/seam_cache.rs` — store entry, encoded-byte
  env, streaming checksummed encode helper, safe shard-path join
- `crates/ripr/src/atomic_file.rs` — `write_cache_streamed`
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/seam_classification.rs` — test-only clone
  counter on `ClassifiedSeam`

## Metrics

- Ordinary encoded shard/single-entry bytes `<=` configured ceiling
- Auxiliary live store memory `<=` bounded IO buffer + serializer scratch
  + bounded metadata
- Host-scoped 10k/self-dogfood store-phase RSS remains
  `not_established` in this change; #3794 retains that observation
