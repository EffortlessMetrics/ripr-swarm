# RIPR-SPEC-0198: Blind journey prompt, intervention and transcript receipt contract

Status: proposed

Owner: test-infra

Created: 2026-10-02

Linked issues:

- #4603 (this slice)
- #4600 (parent blind installed-agent acceptance)
- #3797 (blind journey authority)
- #4510 (shared candidate/process harness; admission authority, referenced not copied)
- #4508 (deterministic journey inputs; public journey fields, no answer key copied)
- #4604 (named execution consumer; must consume this exact merged contract identity)

Support-tier impact:

- None. The validator is an offline typed projection over committed fixture
  packets; it launches no candidate, edits nothing, calls no provider and
  collects no telemetry. [docs/status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md](../status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md)

Policy impact:

- None. No new process, network or file-policy surface; the report reads the
  committed corpus and receipt and renders to stdout/`target/ripr/reports`
  only.

## Problem

#4600 requires an uninformed operator to use only the installed product,
public docs/help and ordinary source inspection. That claim needs a reusable
machine contract before the candidate run begins, otherwise the final
evaluator can define "hidden help", omit inconvenient interventions, or
strengthen a partial transcript after seeing the result. The generic #4510
packet knows candidate identity, commands, processes, artifacts and cleanup;
it does not know what the operator was initially told, which information was
prohibited, which actions were product-supported versus private assistance,
whether the prompt leaked the answer key, or whether a transcript is complete
enough for independent audit.

## Behavior

`cargo xtask blind-journey-contract` (#4603) validates the committed
manifest-only corpus `fixtures/blind_journey_contract/corpus.json` through one
typed, versioned contract and validator in `xtask/src/blind_journey.rs`:

- `BlindJourneyPromptV1` retains the candidate/package/binary identity
  reference, the target repository/base/head/tree/root identity, the generic
  operator goal, the public docs/help inputs made available, ordinary
  permissions, explicit prohibited hints, the exact prompt bytes and digest,
  the retained named-reviewer verdict, and the producer-recorded mechanical
  contamination result.
- `BlindJourneyAnswerKeyV1` is stored separately from the operator input and
  retains eligible canonical items, quiet/already-covered neighbors, the
  expected safe target/edit cage, the discriminator family, known product
  limitations and forbidden edits, plus its canonical digest.
- `BlindJourneyEventV1` captures observable activity only (product command
  invocations, followed outputs, public documentation lookups, ordinary
  target-source reads, operator questions and product-option selections,
  file edits, project verification, static analysis, receipt execution,
  process cleanup, and harness/evaluator interventions). Every event binds
  sequence/predecessor, an exact subject, input/output digests and whether it
  was operator visible at that point. Private chain-of-thought is never
  required or stored.
- `BlindJourneyInterventionV1` is one closed taxonomy of ten classes. The
  first four (`product_supported`, `ordinary_source_inspection`,
  `public_documentation_lookup`,
  `operator_choice_within_product_options`) may appear in a positive run;
  `instrument_only_not_operator_visible` may record watchdog/process/
  filesystem observation without changing the operator path or product state;
  the remaining five (`hidden_operator_knowledge`, `manual_artifact_plumbing`,
  `private_harness_hint`, `workspace_binary_substitution`,
  `unsafe_or_unbounded_action`) make the positive blind claim false. Every
  non-product action carries one classification, an actor, an exact
  reason and, where applicable, exact bytes/subject. Free-form "assisted a
  little" is invalid.
- `BlindJourneyReceiptV1` binds the exact reviewed prompt and answer-key
  digests, the recorded selection and edit, the event transcript, the
  separate evidence axes (candidate/currentness, selection correctness,
  edit-cage verdict, project verification status, static movement, receipt
  status, operator assistance state, and external runtime/mutation evidence
  when separately supplied) and one terminal result from the closed thirteen
  value vocabulary. Only `passed_blind_journey` is the positive row; negative
  controls retain their own expected result and no aggregate percentage
  converts them into success.

Two contamination judgments stay mechanically distinct. A closed structured
scan over the exact prompt bytes rejects issue/PR or internal campaign
references, selected fixture families, preselected gap/seam/item ids, target
files/tests/functions, command sequences beyond public entrypoint permission,
non-public artifact paths, private expected results or workarounds, internal
source references and prior transcript content. A retained named-reviewer
verdict over the exact prompt and separately stored answer key addresses
semantic answer leakage. Keyword absence is not evidence of semantic
blindness; a supplied reviewer label never overrides a mechanical finding;
and until a current accepted reviewer verdict exists, the validator refuses a
positive blind result.

The validator fails closed: hidden hints, manual plumbing, wrong binaries and
unsafe or wrong edits cannot produce a positive receipt; a quiet-neighbor
selection fails the answer-key comparison; a passing verification or static
axis cannot hide operator assistance; an honest limitation stays an accepted
non-positive receipt with the complete transcript and exact recovery
non-claim; missing predecessors, reordered traces, altered prompt bindings,
changed answer keys and human/machine disagreement reject; equivalent
concrete root spellings share one portable semantic identity while concrete root
evidence remains retained; and an unsupported future schema rejects instead of
aggregating to a clean pass. Answer-key bytes remain evaluator-only: the
operator-visible projection is scanned for exact absence of answer-key
contents and references at the event boundary. Timestamps, durations, PIDs
and absolute temporary-root spelling stay telemetry.

JSON and Markdown derive from one evaluated DTO, so prose cannot strengthen
machine state. The committed decision receipt
`metrics/blind-journey-contract/contract-receipt.json` ratifies the fixture
scope and is rejected when it drifts from the contract schema versions,
carries no limitations, or claims more than the fixture evidence supports.

## Required Evidence

- `cargo xtask blind-journey-contract` rebuilds the assessment in CI, checks
  the committed corpus against the live validator, validates the decision
  receipt, and writes `target/ripr/reports/blind-journey-contract.{md,json}`.
- `cargo test -p xtask blind_journey` covers the validator units: the
  contamination categories, the intervention taxonomy, the digest bindings,
  the event-chain ordering controls, the secrecy projection, the portable
  identity and the terminal result consistency.
- `cargo test -p xtask blind_journey_contract` covers the gate: committed
  corpus drift, drifted contract receipts, receipts without limitations and
  projection determinism.
- `cargo xtask check-fixture-contracts` runs the corpus through the same
  validator on every policy pass.

## Non-Goals

- No candidate execution, operator/model evaluation, prompt optimization,
  model scoring or private chain-of-thought collection.
- No product command or repair implementation.
- No candidate admission, selection, publication, tag, release or source
  merge; #4510 stays the admission authority and #4604 the execution consumer.
- No claim that any candidate passes the journey.

## Acceptance Examples

1. A clean generic prompt validates `passed_blind_journey`; appending an
   issue number, target test, gap id, artifact path or expected command to
   the prompt bytes rejects each category independently.
2. A packet with a classified private hint after a failed command records
   `hidden_operator_assistance` even when verification passed and static
   movement improved.
3. A packet that manually copies a before/verify artifact records
   `manual_artifact_plumbing`; a planted binary records
   `candidate_identity_failure`; neither can produce a positive receipt.
4. A packet whose operator selects the quiet neighbor records
   `wrong_or_stale_subject`; selecting either of two eligible items keeps the
   receipt positive.
5. A reordered trace, a missing predecessor, altered prompt bytes or a
   changed answer key rejects with the exact digest or chain reason.
6. Two packets identical except for concrete root spelling share
   one portable semantic identity and both validate.
7. A hand-edited decision receipt that drifts from the contract schema
   versions or drops its limitations fails the report gate.

## Test Mapping

- `xtask/src/blind_journey.rs` unit tests: contract units, digest bindings,
  contamination, taxonomy, ordering, secrecy, portable identity and terminal
  consistency.
- `xtask/src/reports/blind_journey.rs` tests: committed corpus and receipt
  gate, drift rejections, projection determinism.
- `cargo xtask blind-journey-contract` is itself a CI-executable proof of the
  live assessment and the receipt agreement.
