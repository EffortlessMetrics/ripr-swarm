Support-tier impact:

- None. The corpus measures verdict accuracy on named cases. It does not
  promote a language, editor surface, gate, or public support claim.
- Claim boundaries remain governed by
  [support tiers](../status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md).

Policy impact:

- Register this spec in `policy/doc-artifacts.toml` and
  `.ripr/traceability.toml`.
- Add `fixtures/rust-verdict-corpus` to the manifest-only fixture set.
- Retained upstream Rust files are stored as `<name>.rs.txt`, byte-identical
  to upstream, and get their `.rs` name back only in the run-owned copy. The
  vendored code is fixture data: it adds no workspace Rust, no lint or
  process-policy allowlist rows, and no lines to the PR diff-scope budget.
- No new crates, binaries, dependencies, network allowlist rows, process
  spawn sites, or support-tier changes. The harness reuses the fixture
  runner's ripr build and process owner.

## Problem

Trust in a ripr verdict has been argued from anecdotes: one serde loop that
ripr refused, one report that said "no static test path" beside 81 related
tests. Existing judged panels
([RIPR-SPEC-0092](RIPR-SPEC-0092-python-judged-pr-panel.md) for Python, the
Rust judged-behavior panel seed) fix the vocabulary of both error directions
but carry synthetic or unjudged Rust subjects. Nothing measures how often
ripr's Rust verdict is wrong on real tests whose behavior has been worked
out, so a fix to one verdict cannot show it did not break another.

## Behavior

`fixtures/rust-verdict-corpus/` (`ripr_verdict_corpus.v1`) holds
subjects and cases. `corpus.json` carries only the corpus header; each
subject is `subjects/<subject_id>.json` beside its retained files and each
case is `cases/<case_id>.json` beside its diff. A record file must be named
after the id it holds, and records load in file-name order. One file per
record lets parallel PRs add cases without editing a shared array, and the
corpus carries no version line that every PR would bump.

A subject has an `origin`. An `upstream` subject (the default) is one
pinned upstream repository: URL, 40-hex commit, version label, license, an
optional reference into the shared Rust corpus manifest (`corpus_version`
`2026-10-04.1`), and the retained excerpt files under `subjects/<id>/` with
their sha256. Retained files are byte-identical to the upstream commit and
include its license files.

An `authored` subject is a small crate written for this corpus to fill a
verdict or probe-family cell the upstream cases leave empty. Its id starts
with `authored-` (an upstream id may not), it carries no upstream URL,
commit, or shared-corpus reference, its license is this repository's
(`MIT OR Apache-2.0`), it retains no license file of its own, and the whole
crate is retained. Its cases carry runtime truth exactly as upstream cases
do, with the whole stored crate standing in for the pinned checkout.
Authored cases are chosen to fill cells, so their rates are not real-world
rates: the report gives the false-verdict, false-actionable, false-exposed,
false-silent, ideal, and abstention rates again per origin under
`by_origin`, and a row names its origin.

A case is one edit in one subject: a unified diff under `cases/`, the
anchored file and line the diff adds, the edit kind, behavior family, test
shape, an optional hard-case note, the truth label, the expected verdicts,
written reasoning, and what ripr reported when the case was labeled.

Truth is runtime evidence. The edit was applied to the full pinned checkout
and the crate's own test command run. For a `behavior_preserving_rewrite`
the edit keeps tests green and each listed mutant of the edited expression
was applied on top; for a `behavior_change` the edit is its own single
mutant. A mutant counts as detected (`tests_failed`) when the test command
fails after compiling.
Each mutant carries a written equivalence review and the test that failed.
A mutant that is equivalent in the pinned build cannot carry truth: its
passing tests show nothing about a missing discriminator. A reported miss
that turns out equivalent is replaced by a non-equivalent mutant of the same
expression, or the line is left out. Truth runs in a build that compiles
the anchored line and enables the features its behavior depends on; a mutant
in code a feature gate leaves out is not evidence. Each case records the
toolchain and test command its truth ran under.
Truth derives from how many mutants failed the tests: all is `discriminated`, none is
`not_discriminated`, otherwise `partially_discriminated`.

Expected verdicts follow one table the validator enforces:

| Truth | Ideal | Acceptable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| discriminated | credited | credited, limited, silent |
| partially_discriminated | gap | gap, limited |
| not_discriminated | gap | gap, limited |

The observed verdict reads only candidate-current findings on the anchor:
`exposed` is credited; a named `static_limit_kind` or a `no_static_path`,
`infection_unknown`, `propagation_unknown`, or `static_unknown` class is
limited; any other class is a gap; no anchored finding is silent. When the
anchor is a changed single-line `let`, RIPR-SPEC-0157 moves ripr's probe to
the predicate that uses the binding, so the projection also reads
candidate-current findings in the anchor file whose evidence carries
``binding_predicate_relation: changed binding `<name>` `` for the binding the
anchor declares, with the anchor's initializer as the new initializer, and
the row records `followed_retarget`. The case keeps the line its diff adds as
its anchor. Only a plain `let name` (optionally `mut`) is followed; patterns
fail closed. This couples the projection to the wording of that evidence
line: a wording change stops the following, and a retargeting case then
reads silent until the projection is updated. A gap on
the line outranks credit, and credit outranks a limit. The per-finding
reading mirrors the human "Start here" triage. The line-level precedence is
this corpus's own policy, not triage's ranking: triage orders findings to
pick where to start, while the corpus asks which verdict a developer reading
the line would act on, and a gap there routes repair work.

Each case scores as `ideal`, `abstained` (acceptable but not ideal),
`false_actionable` (a gap where tests discriminate), `false_exposed` (credit
where they do not fully), or `false_silent` (no verdict where they do not
fully).

Contradictions are internal to ripr's output and need no label:
`reach_yes_without_related_tests`, `no_static_path_with_related_tests`,
`exposed_without_discriminator`, `related_tests_listed_exceed_total`, and
summary counts that disagree with the findings list.

`cargo xtask verdict-corpus` has five subcommands:

- `validate` checks the corpus offline: schema, record file names, subject
  digests and unlisted files, diff anchors, truth derived from mutant
  outcomes, and the label table.
- `report [--cases <id,...>] [--out <dir>]` copies each subject to a
  run-owned workspace under `target/ripr/verdict-corpus/`, applies the case
  diff with a strict patch reader that refuses drifted context, runs
  `ripr check --json` on the cases in parallel, and writes `report.json` and
  `report.md`. It refuses an `--out` inside the expected directory.
- `check [--cases <id,...>] [--out <dir>]` does the same and fails, naming
  each case, when a row differs from
  `fixtures/rust-verdict-corpus/expected/rows/<case_id>.json`. A
  whole-corpus run also fails when the summary differs from
  `expected/summary.json`, a row file is missing, or `expected/` holds any
  other file. `--cases` compares only the named rows, for the inner loop
  while writing a case.
- `bless` runs the whole corpus and replaces `expected/` with the summary and
  one row file per case.
- `split` moves a one-file `corpus.json`'s subjects and cases into record
  files and drops its `corpus_version`, skipping records that already exist
  with the same content and naming any that differ.

The required Rust gate runs `check` on the whole corpus at Draft -> Ready and
on main pushes. Truth labels are stored with each case, so no CI job reruns
mutants.

The report states false-verdict, false-actionable (over discriminated
cases), false-exposed and false-silent (over the rest), ideal, abstention,
and contradiction rates as exact fractions, the verdict rates again per
subject origin, and one row per case with its origin and a
`changed_since_labeling` flag.

The contradiction rate counts candidate-current findings across each case's
whole `ripr check` run, not only the anchor line, because a
self-contradicting finding anywhere is an internal inconsistency.
`contradictions_by_code` uses the same unit: findings carrying each code,
plus one per run for a summary-count code. A row's `contradictions` lists
the distinct codes seen in that case's run.

## Required Evidence

- The committed corpus validates and contains both a `discriminated` and a
  `not_discriminated` case.
- Each validation rule rejects a tampered corpus.
- The scoring table, verdict projection, contradiction codes, and rate
  arithmetic are pinned by unit tests.
- The committed expected rows agree with the corpus labels row by row.
- A record file named after another id is refused; `split` reproduces the
  one-file corpus exactly; a moved, missing, or stale row and a drifted
  summary are each named, and a `--cases` run compares only its rows.
- The validator holds upstream subjects to a pinned URL, commit, and license
  file, and authored subjects to the `authored-` id prefix, no upstream
  provenance, no license file, and this repository's license; the report
  keeps authored rates apart from upstream rates. Relabeling a vendored
  excerpt as authored therefore means renaming the subject and every case
  that names it, which review sees; the validator cannot detect a rename
  that also strips the license file.

## Non-Goals

- Running mutation testing, `cargo test`, or network access from the
  harness. Truth was established once, at labeling, and is recorded.
- A population estimate. Rates describe these cases only.
- Replacing the judged panels or the shared Rust corpus; this corpus draws
  on the shared corpus pins where they exist.
- A diff-selected CI subset. An analyzer change can move any verdict, so
  selection by touched paths would pick the whole corpus for exactly the
  PRs that matter; the whole run is cheap enough to stay the CI tier.

## Acceptance Examples

- serde `format_u8` (`n >= 100` rewritten as `n > 99`): both boundary
  mutants fail `test_format_u8`, which checks all 256 values inside `loop`.
  ripr reports `reachable_unrevealed`, so the case scores
  `false_actionable`. A `static_limit` on the loop would score `abstained`.
- semver 1.0.23 `digit > b'9'` to `digit >= b'9'` (the first-run edit):
  four semver tests fail, so the tests discriminate the change. ripr 0.10's
  `reachable_unrevealed` would score `false_actionable`; the current
  `infection_unknown` scores `abstained`.
- itoa `remain > 9` rewritten as `remain >= 10`: the macro-generated tests
  still pass under both mutants, so a gap is ideal and ripr's
  `no_static_path` scores `abstained`.
- strsim `dacc84c` `src/lib.rs:195` `sim > 0.7`: the spot-check's `>=`
  miss is equivalent: no string pair up to 70 characters long gives a Jaro
  value of exactly 0.7. The case uses threshold shifts instead: 0.75 fails a
  test and 0.65 does not, so the truth is `partially_discriminated` and ripr's `weakly_exposed` scores
  `ideal`.
- authored `pricing-quote-total-field` (`subtotal + shipping` rewritten as
  `shipping + subtotal` in a struct literal): the only test asserting
  `total_cents` uses a free-shipping order, so dropping the shipping term
  passes while dropping the subtotal fails. The truth is
  `partially_discriminated`, and ripr's `exposed` scores `false_exposed`, in
  the authored rates only.
- authored `checkout-tax-self-computed-expected` (`subtotal * 8 / 100`
  rewritten as `subtotal * 2 * 4 / 100`): the only test's expected value is
  `sub + tax(sub)`, computed through the changed function, so every mutant
  passes and the truth is `not_discriminated`. ripr's `exposed` scores
  `false_exposed`, the self-computed expected value RIPR-SPEC-0004 and
  RIPR-SPEC-0035 say must not count as a strong oracle.
- bytesize `as_kb` division (`src/lib.rs:258`): ripr reports
  `no_static_path` while naming related tests, recorded as
  `no_static_path_with_related_tests`. semver `op()` at 1.0.23
  (`src/parse.rs:272`) carried `reach_yes_without_related_tests` until #5424
  named every examined test; its row now records no contradiction.
