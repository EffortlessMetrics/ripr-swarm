Linked issues:

- #4790 — shared witness adapters and a diff/repo parity corpus (this slice)
- #3160 — parent typed witness kernel campaign
- #3507 — portable `TestEvidenceSummary` projection
- #3402 — `PropagationWitnessV1` adapter

- #4793 — later propagation/observation alignment (not this slice)
- #4794 — later duplicate-builder deletion (not this slice)

Support-tier impact:

- None. This spec adds an internal analysis projection and a paired parity
  corpus. It does not promote a language, gate, editor surface, or public
  support claim.
- Claim boundaries remain governed by
  [support tiers](../status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md).

Policy impact:

- Register this spec in `policy/doc-artifacts.toml` and
  `.ripr/traceability.toml`.
- No new crates, binaries, public schemas, cache generations, network
  allowlist rows, process spawners, or support-tier changes.

## Problem

Rust diff findings and repository seam grip share five-stage vocabulary but
not one comparable evidence record. Canonical gap IDs and output
reconciliation reduce visible drift; they do not prove that both paths
projected the same producer facts. Later slices cannot migrate authority
until there is a shared witness and a discriminating parity denominator.

## Behavior

`analysis::witness` defines one internal `BehaviorEvidenceWitnessV1` and
projects existing `Finding` and `ClassifiedSeam` facts into it.

The witness retains portable item identity, language and family, owner and
normalized expression, required discriminator and expected sink, candidate
versus established test relations, five stage records, selected target or
typed absence, earliest unresolved edge, limitations and non-claims, a
public-class projection, and a semantic digest.

Each stage record retains producer state, basis, source identities,
established versus candidate facts, first unresolved edge, confidence, and
limitations. Adapters copy producer stage meaning; they do not recompute
`ExposureClass`, `SeamGripClass`, actionability, cache generation, or route
readiness.

Missing or unrepresentable source facts become typed adapter limitations.
Candidate-only relations stay candidate and cannot appear as established
reach. Absolute checkout spelling, timestamps, traversal order, renderer
prose, line movement, and volatile process identities stay outside the
portable semantic digest.

A deterministic paired parity report compares two witnesses and records
`equal`, `explained_scope_difference`, `contradiction`, or `not_comparable`.
JSON and Markdown derive from the same normalized DTO. Inherent
diff-only versus workspace-complete pairing is the normal cross-path
comparison; it does not by itself explain a discriminator, oracle, or
stage contradiction. Partial index, stale or wrong input, preview language,
and named cross-language limits may explain a difference.

## Required Evidence

- One shared witness can represent both current Rust analysis paths.
- Diff and repo adapters are pure projections over existing producer facts.
- The paired corpus covers the load-bearing families in #4790.
- Removing one source identity or digest makes the row `not_comparable`.
- Reordering source facts yields byte-stable JSON and Markdown.
- Same-name owner or test tokens cannot join unrelated portable identities.
- Public classes on the source `Finding` / `ClassifiedSeam` are unchanged.

## Non-Goals

- no classifier or route behavior change
- no new owner, relation, activation, propagation, observation, oracle, or
  discriminator producer
- no removal of existing stage builders
- no public schema, protocol, cache-generation, support-tier, release, or
  publication change
- no #4792–#4794 authority migration or deletion

## Acceptance Examples

1. Matching equality-boundary facts on both paths, before and after an exact
   test, compare `equal`; crossing before with after is not `equal`.
2. Exact error versus broad error, sibling field, unrelated strong
   assertion, missing observer, sibling match arm, and discriminator
   mismatch compare `contradiction`.
3. Partial-index versus workspace-complete relation sets, stale or wrong
   input on one path, and preview/cross-language limits compare
   `explained_scope_difference`.
4. A producer `reach=yes` backed only by `weak_token_substring` keeps that
   relation in candidate facts and names
   `producer_reach_without_established_relation`.
5. A favorable observation stage paired with an absent stage is not `equal`.

## Implementation Mapping

- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/witness/mod.rs` — witness record and semantic digest
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/witness/stage.rs` — stage projection
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/witness/relations.rs` — candidate versus established split
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/witness/adapters.rs` — finding and classified-seam adapters plus production retain hooks
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/classifier/finding.rs` — diff-path retain after `build_finding`
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/seam_inventory.rs` — repo-path retain after classify
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/witness/parity.rs` — paired report DTO
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/witness/tests.rs` — corpus and controls

## Metrics

This slice does not claim a public metric. Internal parity-row counts by
disposition are test evidence only; they are not a support-tier or
classifier-quality score.
