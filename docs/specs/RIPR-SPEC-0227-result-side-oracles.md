- #5416 (unknown, not a gap: a weak oracle ripr read keeps the gap)

Support-tier impact:

- No tier change. Oracles that observe only which side of a `Result` a call
  returned are named as one oracle class with one rule: they never confirm a
  changed error variant or a changed `Ok` value, and they confirm a change
  that flips the side only when the same test feeds an input on which the
  side flips. Claim boundaries remain governed by
  [support tiers](../status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md).

Policy impact:

- Register this spec in `policy/doc-artifacts.toml` and
  `.ripr/traceability.toml`.
- No schema version bump. Oracle kinds stay `broad_error` and `smoke_only`;
  this spec names their contract.

## Problem

Tests often check only whether a call failed:

```rust
assert!(check(300).is_err());
assert!(matches!(check(300), Err(_)));
let _e = check(300).unwrap_err();
#[should_panic] fn rejects() { check(300).unwrap(); }
```

Each observes the side of the `Result`, not its contents. ripr reads them
inconsistently today (origin/main, measured with `ripr check --diff`):

- `is_err()` and `Err(_)` are `broad_error` / weak; `is_ok()`, `unwrap()` and
  `expect()` are `smoke_only` / smoke (`analysis/extract/oracles/classify.rs`).
- A bare `let e = f().unwrap_err();` is not an assertion line
  (`analysis/extract/oracles/scan.rs`), so it is no oracle at all and the
  finding reads `reachable_unrevealed`.
- A `#[should_panic]` attribute line is scanned but classified `unknown`;
  only owner-pin admission consults it, to refuse credit
  (`analysis/classify/owner_pin.rs`).

RIPR-SPEC-0107 covers one shape: a changed error variant with an `is_err()`
test reads `weakly_exposed`. No spec covers `Err(_)`, `unwrap_err()`,
`should_panic` or `is_ok()`, and none covers the case where a broad oracle is
a real discriminator: a guard that decides between `Ok` and `Err`.

```rust
pub fn check(len: usize) -> Result<usize, E> {
    if len >= 256 { return Err(E::TooLong); }   // changed from `len > 256`
    Ok(len)
}

#[test]
fn boundary() {
    assert!(check(256).is_err());
    assert!(check(255).is_ok());
}
```

The mutant back to `len > 256` flips `check(256)` from `Err` to `Ok`, and
this test fails. ripr
reads the predicate `weakly_exposed` ("Only broad error oracle"), a false
actionable gap. The "Fill spec-defined corpus cases" ledger crate also
reports both of its error-path findings `exposed` when the only test asserts
`is_err()` and a wrong variant passes; that observation conflicts with the
`weakly_exposed` reading above and is a defect against this spec either way.

## Behavior

### Result-side oracles

A **result-side oracle** observes only whether an owner call returned `Ok`
or `Err` (or `Some` or `None`):

- `assert!(r.is_err())`, `assert!(r.is_ok())`, `assert!(!r.is_ok())` and the
  `Option` twins;
- `assert!(matches!(r, Err(_)))`, `assert!(matches!(r, Ok(_)))`;
- `r.unwrap_err()` or `r.expect_err(..)` whose value is never compared;
- `r.unwrap()` or `r.expect(..)` whose value is never compared;
- `#[should_panic]` without `expected`, only when unwrapping the owner result
  with `unwrap()` or `expect()` is the sole possible panic source on the
  test's execution path (no other `panic!`, assertion, indexing, unwrap or
  call that may panic, and no panic source inside the owner itself on that
  input).

`#[should_panic(expected = "..")]` with a message is not a result-side oracle;
it belongs to message-bound authorities.

Kinds keep their existing names: the `Err` side reads `broad_error`, the `Ok`
side reads `smoke_only`. Both are weak for every case below except rules 3 and
3b. A bare `unwrap_err()` and `should_panic` produce the oracle instead of
nothing.

### Rule 1: variants and values

A result-side oracle never confirms a changed error variant (`Err(E::A)` to
`Err(E::B)`), a changed `Ok` or `Some` value, or a changed payload. The
finding reads at most `weakly_exposed`, and the gap is kept: the #5416
unknown-not-a-gap rules do not withhold a gap whose only oracle is
result-side, because ripr read the oracle and it is weak. An `exposed` reading
in these shapes is a defect.

### Rule 2: far inputs

A result-side oracle on an input that does not sit where the side flips
(`check(300).is_err()` for the guard above) reads at most `weakly_exposed`.

### Rule 3: side flips

A result-side oracle confirms a change when all of these hold:

1. the changed expression is a `predicate` guard whose taken branch returns
   one side (`return Err(..)`, `return Ok(..)`, or `None` / `Some`);
2. the same test calls the owner with a resolved input that reaches the
   guard with no earlier `return`, `?` or panic on that path, and for which
   the guard's outcome differs between the original and the changed
   predicate (the boundary inputs of RIPR-SPEC-0186);
3. on that input the code after the untaken guard returns the other side,
   with no later `return`, `?` or panic that could return the same side
   either way;
4. the oracle on that call observes the side.

Then discrimination is confirmed and the finding may read `exposed`. When
the input is unresolved or the side flip cannot be established, rule 2
applies.

### Rule 3b: `?` side flips

Decision 3 extends rule 3 to an added or removed `?`. A result-side oracle
confirms that change when all of these hold:

1. the change adds or removes a `?` on one call `c` in the owner (for
   example `digit(ch)?` from `digit(ch).unwrap_or(0)`);
2. the same test calls the owner with a resolved input that reaches that
   line with no earlier `return`, `?` or panic on that path, and for which
   `c` provably returns `Err`;
3. on that input the version without the `?` continues and provably returns
   the other side (`Ok`), with no later `return`, `?` or panic that could
   return `Err` either way;
4. the oracle on that call observes the side.

When any condition is not established, RIPR-SPEC-0107 applies and the
finding stays `weakly_exposed`. A control where `c` returns `Ok` on the test
input never confirms (example 12).

### Rule 4: variant oracles bind to the owner and the variant

An exact-variant oracle (`assert_eq!(call, Err(E::X))`,
`assert!(matches!(call, Err(E::X)))`, an `unwrap_err()` binding compared to
`E::X` under RIPR-SPEC-0106, or a guarded `Result` match that pins `E::X`
under RIPR-SPEC-0175) confirms an `error_path` or `return_value` probe that
returns `Err(E::X)` only when both of these hold. They are necessary
conditions, not sufficient ones; every other stage still applies:

- its call is to the changed owner, admitted by RIPR-SPEC-0197 call
  identity; and
- `X` is the variant the changed expression returns.

A test of another function in the same file that pins the same variant, or a
test of the owner that pins a sibling variant, does not confirm, whatever
other related-test evidence exists. This combines RIPR-SPEC-0107 (variant
token) with RIPR-SPEC-0197 (owner identity). The "Fill spec-defined corpus
cases" authored ledger and checkout crates (truth from real mutant runs,
not yet committed) show three `exposed` readings on main e177461 that break
it, each credited from another function's
`matches!(refund(..), Err(PayError::Limit))` or a sibling-variant
`assert_eq!`; examples 10 and 11 below restate them.

### Decisions

Steven delegated these choices on 2026-10-04 ("make reasonable documented
decisions and proceed"). Each records the adopted option, why, and the
rejected alternative. Any can be reversed later without touching the rest.

1. **Rule 3 credit.** Adopted. Without it, the common
   `is_err`/`is_ok` boundary test stays a false gap. Rejected: keep every
   result-side oracle weak.
2. **Bare `unwrap_err()` and `should_panic`.** Adopted: read them as
   result-side oracles (weak), moving their findings from
   `reachable_unrevealed` to `weakly_exposed` and letting rule 3 apply,
   because a test that panics on the wrong side does observe the side.
   Rejected: keep them unread.
3. **The `?` operator.** An added or removed `?` swaps `Err` for `Ok` the same
   way a guard does, but a `?` line is an `error_path` probe, and
   RIPR-SPEC-0107 says a broad oracle never confirms `error_path`. Adopted:
   amend RIPR-SPEC-0107 so rule 3 applies to `?` when the test input provably
   reaches the `?` call's `Err` and the original and changed code provably
   return different sides on that input (rule 3b), because then the side alone
   tells the original from the change; when any of these is not established,
   RIPR-SPEC-0107 still applies. RIPR-SPEC-0107 records this exception.
   Rejected: leave `?` under RIPR-SPEC-0107 (always weak with a broad oracle).
4. **Establishing rule 3b without evaluating the input.** Adopted
   (2026-10-07). It also widens condition 1: a changed line that keeps the
   same `?` call is covered, and the claim is that a test would notice if
   that `?` were swallowed. "The same `?`" means the old and new statement
   read equal after ignoring whitespace, dropping parentheses that wrap the
   whole `?` operand when that operand is already a call, method call,
   path, field, index, literal or `.await` (`(a + b)?` is not `a + b?`),
   and reading a single turbofish on the `?` call of an
   unannotated `let` as that type's annotation (`let p = s.parse::<u16>()?`
   and `let p: u16 = s.parse()?` agree). Every other token counts, so a
   changed callee, generic argument, annotation or enclosing call does not
   agree, and neither does an attribute on the `let`
   (`parse_lenient(s)?` to `parse_strict(s)?`, `parse::<u16>` to
   `parse::<u8>`, `push_u16(s.parse()?)` to `push_u8(..)`), since a side
   oracle cannot see which error or which failing inputs come back
   (rule 1). A removed line, a `?` with no same-statement removed
   counterpart and any other change keep the RIPR-SPEC-0107 reading.
   When the changed `?` is the owner's only possible source of
   `Err`, a passing test that asserts the owner call returns `Err` proves
   condition 2 (that call took the `?`'s `Err`), and condition 3 follows
   because swallowing the `?` leaves no other way to return `Err`. "Only
   source" means a free, attribute-free function returning `Result<..>` whose
   body has exactly one `?`, no `return`, no `Err` path, no closure, macro or
   nested item, and an `Ok(..)` tail; the `?` operand must not shape the
   error (`map_err`, `ok_or`, `or_else`, `context`, or a value path naming a
   type or variant), because rule 1 still holds. The assertion must be a
   top-level statement of a plain `#[test]` that calls the owner directly by
   name (`is_err()`, `!is_ok()`, `matches!(.., Err(_))`, or a bare
   `unwrap_err()` / `expect_err()`), in a test file with no `macro_rules!`,
   no inherited parent context and no inner attribute other than
   `#![cfg(test)]`, no `#[macro_use]`, no `use` or `use .. as` naming
   `assert`, `assert_eq`, `assert_ne` or `matches` and no glob import other than `super::*`, `self::*` or
   `crate::*`; no other macro call in the test body or in the owner call's
   arguments, no `return`, closure or block in those arguments (a skip
   macro can return early), and no attribute on the assertion statement. The
   premise that the test passes on the current code is assumed, as it is for
   every ripr reading, not checked. Any other shape keeps the
   RIPR-SPEC-0107 reading. Rejected: evaluate `c` on the test input (a
   std-library and user-code interpreter ripr does not have) or withhold
   these findings as `static_unknown` (rule 1 keeps the gap for a weak
   oracle ripr did read).

## Required Evidence

- A variant change with an `is_err()` test, a `matches!(r, Err(_))` test, a
  bare `unwrap_err()` test and a `should_panic` test each reads
  `weakly_exposed` for `error_path` and `return_value`, never `exposed`.
- The boundary reproduction above reads `exposed` for the predicate.
- A far-input-only control (`check(300).is_err()`) reads `weakly_exposed`.
- A split control (`let _ = check(256)` in one test, `check(300).is_err()` in
  another) reads at most `weakly_exposed` (RIPR-SPEC-0186).
- `Ok(len)` changed to `Ok(len + 1)` with an `is_ok()` test reads
  `weakly_exposed`.

## Non-Goals

- No credit for message text in `should_panic(expected = ..)`.
- No change to exact-variant authorities (RIPR-SPEC-0106, 0107, 0175, 0197)
  beyond rule 4's binding and decision 3's narrow `?` exception to 0107.
- No change to how a `?` probe is confirmed by an exact `Err(E::X)`
  assertion; that under-credit is tracked separately.

## Acceptance Examples

Source: `check` as in Problem.

1. Guard changed to `len >= 256` (from `len > 256`), test
   `assert!(check(256).is_err()); assert!(check(255).is_ok());`: predicate
   `exposed` (rule 3).
2. Same change, test `assert!(check(256).is_err())` alone: predicate `exposed`.
3. Same change, test `assert!(check(300).is_err())` only: `weakly_exposed`.
4. Same change, tests `let _ = check(256);` and `assert!(check(300).is_err())`
   in different tests: at most `weakly_exposed`.
5. `Err(E::TooLong)` changed to `Err(E::Bad)`, test
   `assert!(check(300).is_err())`: `error_path` and `return_value`
   `weakly_exposed`, gap kept under the #5416 unknown-not-a-gap rules.
6. Same change, `#[should_panic] fn t() { check(300).unwrap(); }`:
   `weakly_exposed`.
7. Same change, `let _e = check(300).unwrap_err();`: `weakly_exposed`.
8. `Ok(len)` changed to `Ok(len + 1)`, test `assert!(check(3).is_ok())`:
   `weakly_exposed`.
9. `let d = digit(c)?;` changed from `let d = digit(c).unwrap_or(0);` in
   `total`, where `digit('x')` returns `Err` and the original `total("x")`
   returned `Ok`, test `assert!(total("x").is_err())`: `exposed` (rule 3b;
   `weakly_exposed` under RIPR-SPEC-0107 before this spec).
10. `withdraw` changed to return `Err(PayError::Frozen)`; the only related
    test pinning a variant is `assert!(matches!(refund(20_000),
    Err(PayError::Limit)))` for another function: not `exposed` (rule 4).
11. `parse_amount` changed to return `Err(ParseError::TooLong)`; related tests
    pin `Err(ParseError::Empty)` and `Err(ParseError::BadDigit('x'))` and one
    asserts `is_err()` on a too-long input: `weakly_exposed` (rules 1 and 4).
12. Same change as example 9, test `assert!(total("7").is_ok())`, where
    `digit('7')` returns `Ok`: `weakly_exposed` (rule 3b condition 2 fails;
    both versions return `Ok`).
13. Same change as example 9, test `assert!(total("x").is_err())`, where
    `total` already returned `Err` for `"x"` through an earlier `?`:
    `weakly_exposed` (rule 3b condition 2 fails).

## Test Mapping

- Existing: `fixtures/weak_error_oracle`, `fixtures/unwrap_err_generic_is_err`,
  `fixtures/strong_error_oracle`.
- Verdict corpus: 11 cases `spec0227-*` in
  `fixtures/rust-verdict-corpus/cases/` for acceptance examples 1-9, 12
  and 13, each naming its example in its reasoning and labeled with runtime
  mutant truth. Examples 10 and 11 are covered by the existing cases
  `checkout-withdraw-sibling-variant` and `accounts-parse-too-long-variant`.
- Decision 4: `classifier/evidence/side_flip.rs::tests` (owner, operand and
  test-shape refusals) and `crates/ripr/tests/question_mark_side_flip.rs`
  (end to end: `is_err()` and `matches!(.., Err(_))` read `exposed`; an
  `is_ok()` test, an earlier `?`, a changed operand or statement, a removed
  `?` line, a wrapped or unexecuted assertion and a file-local `assert!`
  macro do not). Corpus:
  `spec0227-total-question-mark-is-err` and `grid-try-exact`.
- Planned: oracle-scan unit tests for bare `unwrap_err()` and `should_panic`.
  Until those land, a bare `unwrap_err()` statement is no oracle and decision
  4 cannot credit it.

## Implementation Mapping

- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/extract/oracles/scan.rs` and `classify.rs`: read
  bare `unwrap_err()` and `should_panic` as result-side oracles.
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/classify/boundary_pairing.rs`: side-flip pairing
  for rules 3 and 3b.
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/classify/reveal.rs`: rule 1 and rules 3 and 3b
  gates.
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/classifier/evidence/side_flip.rs`: rule 3b by
  decision 4, a producer that refines a weak `error_path` discriminator on a
  sole-source `?` line (corpus cases `spec0227-total-question-mark-is-err`
  and `grid-try-exact`; controls `spec0227-total-question-mark-earlier-err`
  and `spec0227-total-question-mark-ok-input` keep their gap).

## Metrics

- `result_side_oracle_variant_credit`: findings confirmed by a result-side
  oracle on a variant or value change; must be zero.
- `result_side_oracle_side_flip_credit`: predicate and `?` findings confirmed
  by a same-test side flip.
