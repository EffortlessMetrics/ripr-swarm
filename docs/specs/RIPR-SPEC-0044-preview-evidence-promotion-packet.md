# RIPR-SPEC-0044: Preview Evidence Promotion Packet

Status: proposed

## Problem

TypeScript and Python preview evidence is intentionally useful before it is
policy-authoritative. RIPR can surface preview findings in reports, summaries,
and editor surfaces, but preview evidence must not become gate-eligible, RIPR
Zero blocking debt, or calibrated confidence by accident.

Maintainers still need a future path to ask:

```text
What would be required before this preview-language class can govern policy?
```

Without a dedicated preview promotion packet, a generic policy promotion packet
could hide the language boundary, treat syntax-first preview evidence like
stable Rust evidence, or imply that visibility is enough for blocking policy.

## Behavior

The preview evidence promotion packet is a read-only advisory report for a
language and evidence class:

```text
ripr policy preview-promote \
  --language typescript \
  --class boundary_gap
```

The default result is blocked:

```text
allowed_now = false
reason = "preview promotion evidence not supplied"
```

The command must never mutate `ripr.toml`, baselines, suppressions, workflows,
branch protection, generated CI defaults, source files, history ledgers, or
preview eligibility. It must not execute a gate, post comments, run analysis,
generate tests, call providers, run mutation testing, or make CI blocking by
default.

Promotion means "allowed to review a future explicit policy change", not
"automatically promote this language or class". Preview evidence remains
visible and advisory unless a later implementation supplies and validates the
required receipts.

## Required Evidence

The report contract is satisfied only when implementation can show:

- `target/ripr/reports/preview-promotion-typescript-boundary-gap.json` and
  `.md`;
- `target/ripr/reports/preview-promotion-python-boundary-gap.json` and `.md`
  for the same command shape when Python is requested;
- `language`, `language_status`, `candidate_class`, `target_status`,
  `allowed_now`, `reason`, `required_evidence`, `supplied_evidence`,
  `missing_evidence`, `required_repairs`, `required_receipts`,
  `rollback_path`, `generated_ci_posture`, `input_artifacts`, `warnings`,
  `unknowns`, `non_goals`, and `limits_note` fields;
- default blocked behavior when promotion evidence is not supplied;
- explicit accounting for fixture corpus coverage, static-limit taxonomy
  coverage, false-positive review, recommendation calibration, dogfood
  receipts, related-test accuracy review, false repair packet review, surface
  consistency, policy signoff, optional mutation calibration, baseline
  behavior, waiver/suppression behavior, rollback path, and generated CI
  posture;
- language status remains `preview` unless a later explicit promotion policy
  changes it;
- no config, baseline, suppression, workflow, branch-protection, generated CI,
  history, source, gate, RIPR Zero, calibrated-confidence, or preview
  eligibility mutation.

## Inputs

The planned command is:

```text
ripr policy preview-promote \
  --language typescript \
  --class boundary_gap \
  --evidence target/ripr/reports/preview-promotion-evidence.json \
  --out target/ripr/reports/preview-promotion-typescript-boundary-gap.json \
  --out-md target/ripr/reports/preview-promotion-typescript-boundary-gap.md
```

The implementation accepts optional explicit evidence input. Missing evidence
must be represented as missing evidence, not silently inferred.

Input parameters:

| Input | Required? | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language | required | Preview language under review, initially `typescript` or `python`. |
| Candidate class | required | Evidence class under review, for example `boundary_gap`. |
| Evidence receipts | optional | Explicit artifact for fixture coverage, static limits, false-positive review, calibration, baseline behavior, waiver/suppression behavior, rollback, and generated CI posture. Missing receipts block promotion. |

# RIPR Preview Evidence Promotion Packet

Language: typescript
Class: boundary_gap
Current status: preview
Target status: policy_eligible
Allowed now: no
Why: preview promotion evidence not supplied

## Missing Evidence

- fixture_corpus_coverage
- static_limit_exclusions
- false_positive_review
- recommendation_calibration
- dogfood_receipts
- related_test_accuracy_review
- false_repair_packet_review
- surface_consistency_review
- policy_signoff
- baseline_behavior
- waiver_suppression_behavior
- rollback_path
- generated_ci_posture

## Required Receipts

- preview-boundary report showing advisory language status
- fixture corpus coverage receipt for TypeScript boundary_gap
- static-limit exclusions receipt for TypeScript boundary_gap
- false-positive review receipt for TypeScript boundary_gap
- recommendation-calibration receipt for TypeScript boundary_gap
- dogfood receipt for TypeScript boundary_gap
- related-test accuracy review receipt for TypeScript boundary_gap
- false repair packet review receipt for TypeScript boundary_gap
- surface consistency receipt for TypeScript boundary_gap
- policy signoff receipt for TypeScript boundary_gap
- baseline behavior receipt for TypeScript boundary_gap
- waiver/suppression behavior receipt for TypeScript boundary_gap
- rollback path receipt for TypeScript boundary_gap
- generated CI posture receipt for TypeScript boundary_gap

## Generated CI Posture

- may upload artifact: yes
- may summarize artifact: yes
- may fail check: no
- may post comment: no
- may mutate config: no
```

## Default Rules

The packet must fail closed:

| Condition | Result |
| --- | --- |
| No promotion evidence supplied | `allowed_now = false`. |
| Language status is `preview` | Evidence remains advisory and non-gating. |
| Required evidence is missing | Promotion is blocked and missing evidence is listed. |
| Optional mutation calibration is missing | Promotion may still be blocked by other required evidence; missing optional mutation calibration must not imply calibrated confidence. |
| Generated CI wants to surface the packet | Artifact upload and summary are allowed; pass/fail authority, required checks, comment posting, config mutation, and default blocking remain denied. |

## Non-Goals

- No actual promotion.
- No gate eligibility change.
- No RIPR Zero inclusion.
- No calibrated confidence.
- No CI blocking.
- No config mutation.
- No baseline mutation or adoption.
- No suppression creation, deletion, or auto-expiry.
- No workflow, branch-protection, or generated CI mutation.
- No history append.
- No gate decision.
- No analyzer behavior changes.
- No evidence identity rewrites.
- No LSP or editor behavior changes.
- No generated tests.
- No provider calls.
- No mutation execution.
- No static evidence claim that runtime behavior was confirmed.

## Acceptance Examples

Default TypeScript packet:

- Command is `ripr policy preview-promote --language typescript --class boundary_gap`.
- `language_status = "preview"`.
- `allowed_now = false`.
- `reason = "preview promotion evidence not supplied"`.
- All required evidence kinds appear in `missing_evidence`.
- Generated CI posture allows upload and summary only.

Python packet with partial receipts:

- Supplied fixture coverage is listed in `supplied_evidence`.
- Missing false-positive review and recommendation calibration remain listed.
- `allowed_now = false`.
- Required repairs name the missing receipts.

Preview boundary protection:

- The packet repeats that preview evidence is not gate-eligible by default.
- The packet does not add RIPR Zero blocking debt.
- The packet does not claim calibrated confidence.
- The packet does not write config, baselines, suppressions, workflows, or
  history ledgers.

## Test Mapping

Implementation includes:

- Output builder tests for default blocked TypeScript and Python packets.
- Output builder tests for partial evidence receipts where missing required
  evidence still blocks promotion.
- JSON and Markdown shape tests for required/supplied/missing evidence,
  generated CI posture, rollback path, non-goals, and limits.
- Tests showing missing optional mutation calibration never creates calibrated
  confidence.
- Tests showing malformed supplied evidence becomes a warning and does not
  mutate or repair inputs.
- CLI option parsing tests for `--language`, `--class`, `--out`, and
  `--out-md`.
- CLI write-path tests proving only the requested JSON and Markdown reports are
  written.

## Implementation Mapping

This spec belongs to the focused Lane 2 tracker in
[Policy operations](../policy/POLICY_OPERATIONS.md).

Implementation is split by work item:

- `spec/preview-evidence-promotion-packet` defines this report contract.
- `policy/preview-promotion-packet-report` implements the read-only
  JSON/Markdown producer in
  `crates/ripr/src/output/policy_preview_promotion.rs` and
  `crates/ripr/src/cli/commands.rs`.
- `docs/policy-operator-workflow` explains how maintainers review preview
  promotion packets without changing preview defaults.
- `ci/policy-operations-advisory-projection` may surface preview promotion
  artifacts as advisory-only uploads and summaries.

No implementation PR may change analyzer truth, evidence identity, gate
semantics, LSP/editor behavior, provider behavior, mutation execution, source
files, generated tests, branch protection, generated CI defaults, config,
baselines, suppressions, history, RIPR Zero inclusion, calibrated confidence,
or preview-language eligibility to satisfy this spec.

## Metrics

The report makes these metrics available to later capability and trend
surfaces:

- `preview_promotion_allowed`
- `preview_promotion_blocked`
- `preview_promotion_required_evidence`
- `preview_promotion_supplied_evidence`
- `preview_promotion_missing_evidence`
