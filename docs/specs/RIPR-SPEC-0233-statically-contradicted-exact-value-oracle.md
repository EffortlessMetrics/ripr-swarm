Support-tier impact:

- No tier change. This spec bounds oracle credit, not a surface: a related
  test whose asserted value statically contradicts the seam owner's fold
  keeps at most `weak` oracle strength, keeps the seam's gap open, and names
  the contradiction in the evidence summary. Claim boundaries remain
  governed by [support tiers](../status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md).

Policy impact:

- Register this spec in `policy/doc-artifacts.toml` and
  `.ripr/traceability.toml`.
- Classified-seam cache generations bump (`1.31` -> `1.32` full and sharded
  `0.37` -> `0.38` compact and sharded) because warm entries would keep
  serving the contradicted assertion's strong credit.
- No repo-exposure schema version bump: the evidence-record shape is
  unchanged; only values and evidence summaries move.

## Problem

A related test that asserts `assert_eq!(owner(literal, ..), literal)` is
credited as a strong `exact_value` oracle even when the asserted literal is
statically wrong. The issue #6026 shape: a boundary crate whose owner folds
(`5_000 * 70 / 100 = 3_500` at the asserted input), plus a test that follows
the repair packet's `exact_return_value` recipe with the wrong expected
literal `5_000` — the value the `>=` -> `>` flip would produce. The test
fails at baseline and would pass under the mutation, so as mutation-exposure
evidence it is exactly inverted. Static evidence credits it as a full
repair: the seam moves `weakly_gripped -> strongly_gripped`, the outcome
receipt reports `improved; gap closed`, and the weak/unknown section is
empty. A statically-evaluably-false assert is indistinguishable from a
correct one, and a wrong actionable repair signal is worse than a missed
advisory finding.

## Behavior

### The fold and the credit bound

The verdict is decided per related-test assertion against the seam owner:

- `assert_eq!`/`debug_assert_eq!` over a bare-path call to the owner with
  literal arguments plus a literal expected value, where the owner is a free
  function of checked integer arithmetic over its parameters (`+ - * / %`,
  comparisons, boolean operators, `if`/`else if`/`else`, negation, integer
  literals with optional suffixes), folds to one integer value.
- Division or remainder by zero, arithmetic overflow, or any shape outside
  that grammar leaves the pair not evaluable — today's credit is retained.
- A fold that contradicts the asserted relation (`!=` for `assert_eq!`,
  `==` for `assert_ne!`) downgrades that assertion to at most `weak`
  strength everywhere the credit is consumed (best-oracle selection,
  discrimination evidence, sink-matching propagation), keeps the seam's gap
  open, and states the contradiction — the asserted literal and the folded
  value — in the stage and related-test evidence summaries.

## Rule

When a related test's equality assertion (`assert_eq!`/`assert_ne!` family)
carries literal arguments and a literal expected value, and the seam's owner
is a free function whose body constant-folds at those arguments:

- The fold result is compared against the asserted relation
  (`assert_eq!` contradicts when the folded value differs; `assert_ne!`
  contradicts when it is equal).
- On contradiction the oracle keeps at most `weak` strength, contributes no
  strong discrimination, and the seam's gap stays open. The evidence
  summary names the contradiction with both values, in the same
  evidence-record channel the receipt already renders.
- The per-seam stage evidence records the contradiction in its summary.
- When the owner is not statically evaluable — a method or nested function,
  a body with calls, `let` bindings, early returns, non-literal operands,
  or arithmetic that is undefined at the asserted input — the verdict is
  not evaluable and today's behavior is retained, including its limitation.
  No taxonomy or value is manufactured from an unavailable fold.
- The fold can only withhold credit, never grant it: a consistent or
  non-evaluable verdict leaves the extracted oracle strength unchanged.

## Discriminating evidence

`wrongval_boundary_assert_does_not_close_the_gap` builds the issue's exact
crate and fails on the pre-fix behavior (the gap closes); the control
`correct_boundary_literal_still_closes_the_gap` keeps the strong credit and
the closure for the correct literal `3_500`; and
`non_evaluable_owner_keeps_the_prior_credit` pins the retained limitation.
The fold's own contract is pinned by `value_contradiction.rs` unit tests
(wrong-valued and correct equality, inverted `assert_ne!`, qualified paths,
else-if chains, negative and suffixed literals, and the not-evaluable
refusals).

## Non-Goals

- No mutation engine and no runtime test execution: the fold is a static,
  bounded constant evaluation, and a consistent verdict is still static
  evidence, never a runtime pass.
- No new oracle kind: a contradicted assertion keeps its extracted
  `exact_value`/`whole_object_equality` kind; only the strength and the
  disclosure move.
- No widening of the fold to method owners, `let`-bound locals, closures,
  or wrapping arithmetic; those stay not-evaluable until a producer owns
  them.
- No change to the repair packet's `exact_return_value` recipe; the packet
  already recommends the correct shape, and the contradiction discloses the
  wrong literal.

## Acceptance Examples

Source: the issue #6026 crate — `discounted_total` with an
`amount_cents >= discount_threshold_cents` boundary and a discounted arm of
`amount_cents * 70 / 100`.

1. Test `assert_eq!(discounted_total(5_000, 5_000), 5_000);` added: the
   owner folds to `3_500` at that input, so the assert is contradicted — the
   oracle reads at most `weak`/`exact_value`, the seam stays
   `weakly_gripped`, the outcome reports no gap closure, and the evidence
   summary names `asserts 5_000, owner folds to 3500`.
2. Test `assert_eq!(discounted_total(5_000, 5_000), 3_500);` added: the fold
   agrees — the oracle stays `strong`, and the gap closes exactly as before.
3. Owner whose discounted arm calls a helper, same wrong literal as (1):
   not statically evaluable — today's credit and the closure are retained,
   with no manufactured evidence either way.

## Test Mapping

- Landed: `value_contradiction.rs` unit tests pin the fold verdicts;
  `test_grip_evidence/tests.rs::wrongval_boundary_assert_does_not_close_the_gap`
  (red on the pre-fix behavior),
  `::correct_boundary_literal_still_closes_the_gap`, and
  `::non_evaluable_owner_keeps_the_prior_credit` pin the credit bound
  end-to-end through `evidence_for_seam` and `classify_seam`.
- Not pinned by the existing honesty corpora: the RIPR-SPEC-0108 corpus
  asserts diff-scoped finding classifications and the actionable-gap corpus
  joins hand-authored receipts, while this rule is the repo-scope seam
  credit. Graduating the wrongval shape into a pinned corpus first needs a
  grip-scoped corpus surface (or the diff-scope counterpart of this rule);
  until then the discriminating tests above are the pinned proof.

## Implementation Mapping

- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/test_grip_evidence/value_contradiction.rs`: the
  fold — assertion shape, owner-call argument extraction, the constant
  folder over the owner's body, and the verdict.
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/test_grip_evidence.rs`: the credit bound —
  `effective_oracle_strength` feeds `best_oracle`, `discriminate_evidence`,
  and `oracles_match_sink`, so a contradicted assertion keeps at most
  `weak` strength, the gap stays open, and the stage and related-test
  summaries name the contradiction.
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/seam_cache.rs`: the classified-seam cache
  generation bumps so warm entries cannot keep serving the strong credit.

## Required Evidence

- The issue #6026 wrongval reproduction: the boundary crate with the
  assert-the-mutant's-value test leaves the seam `weakly_gripped`, the
  outcome receipt reports no gap closure, and the evidence summary names the
  contradiction (red on the pre-fix behavior).
- The correct-literal control (`3_500`) still closes the gap with a strong
  oracle and an unchanged `exact value assertion` summary.
- A not-evaluable owner with the same wrong literal keeps today's credit.
- `cargo xtask goldens check` and `dogfood` show no drift on the existing
  calibration corpus (every pinned fixture assertion folds consistently).

## Metrics

- `statically_contradicted_exact_value_credit`: seams whose only
  strong-oracle path is a statically contradicted equality assertion; the
  credit bound must hold (zero closures from contradicted asserts). Derived
  from the evidence summaries the receipt channels already carry.
