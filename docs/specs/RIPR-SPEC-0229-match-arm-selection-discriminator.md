Support-tier impact:

- No tier change. A Rust `match_arm` finding whose related tests provably
  select a different arm keeps its gap and names the arm that no test selects.
  A finding whose related test provably selects the changed arm and pins the
  result exactly can read `exposed`. Claim boundaries remain governed by
  [support tiers](../status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md).

Policy impact:

- Register this spec in `policy/doc-artifacts.toml` and
  `.ripr/traceability.toml`.
- No schema version bump. The missing discriminator reuses the existing
  `MissingDiscriminatorFact` (`value`, `reason`) and the existing
  `Missing discriminator value:` entry in `Finding.missing`.

## Problem

ripr never decides which arm a test input selects. For a changed `match_arm`
probe, reveal confirms only when an identifier after `::` in the arm pattern
appears somewhere in an assertion, or when a string-literal arm equals a
direct owner-call argument (`analysis/classify/reveal.rs`,
`match_arm_variant_tokens` and `owner_call_literals`). Activation produces no
missing discriminator for the `match_arm` family
(`analysis/classify/activation.rs`, `missing_discriminator_facts` handles
predicate, error path and field construction only). Observed owner arguments
lose their wrapper, so `reason(Some(5))` is recorded as `x = 5`.

Three wrong outcomes follow:

1. **Correct gaps abstain.** `fixtures/match_arm_blind` has one test,
   `assert_eq!(reason(Some(5)), 6)`, and a changed `None => 0` arm. No test
   selects `None`. Under #5416 rule 3 a strong nearest oracle with no named
   missing discriminator is withheld as `static_unknown`
   (`rust_oracle_target_unresolved`), so a real gap reads as an analyzer limit.
   #5432 counts 24 findings across the `match_arm_*`,
   `error_path_diagnostic_*` and `owner_return_pin_identity_traps` fixtures
   on the same route.
2. **Selected arms never credit.** `assert_eq!(reason(None), 0)` pins the
   changed arm exactly and still reads `weakly_exposed`, because `None` has no
   `::` token. Option and Result constructors, integer, char and bool
   literals, ranges, bindings, tuples and `_` never confirm, whatever the
   input. RIPR-SPEC-0093 records this as an accepted failure mode.
3. **An expected-side token confirms a sibling arm.** For
   `match k { Kind::A => Kind::B, Kind::B => Kind::A }` and the test
   `assert_eq!(f(Kind::A), Kind::B)`, a change to the `Kind::B =>` arm is
   confirmed by the `B` on the expected side, although the input selects the
   `Kind::A =>` arm.

## Behavior

### Selection facts

For a changed `match_arm` probe, activation evaluates each related test's
owner calls whose scrutinee is a parameter of the owner and whose argument is
statically resolved. A call **provably selects** an arm when, in source order,
every earlier arm provably does not match the argument and that arm provably
does.

Provable matching is defined for this pattern grammar and no other:

- integer, char, bool and string literals;
- integer ranges with literal bounds (`a..=b`, `a..b`, `..=b`, `a..`);
- enum variant paths, qualified (`Kind::A`) or bare imported, including the
  prelude constructors `Some`, `None`, `Ok` and `Err`;
- tuple-variant and tuple patterns whose subpatterns are in this grammar,
  wildcards (`_`) or bindings;
- or-patterns whose alternatives are all in this grammar;
- a top-level `_` or binding, which matches every argument.

An arm with a guard (`pat if cond`) is not provably matched or provably
unmatched. When a guarded arm comes before or is the changed arm, the call
does not provably select any arm at or after the guard.

A resolved argument is a literal, an enum path or a constructor call of the
grammar above written in the test call itself, or a `let` binding in the same
test whose initializer is one. Arguments from helpers, fixtures, loops,
parameters or other calls are unresolved.

### Naming the unselected arm

When every related test call to the owner is resolved and none provably
selects the changed arm, activation emits one missing discriminator:

- `value`: the changed arm's pattern text, without the guard and `=>`
  (for example `None`).
- `reason`: names the arm and the observed values, for example
  "No related test call selects arm `None =>`; observed `x` values:
  `Some(5)`."

Observed values keep their constructor (`Some(5)`, not `5`).

The finding keeps its gap (`weakly_exposed` when a related test holds an
oracle on the result, `reachable_unrevealed` when none does). Because a
missing discriminator is named, RIPR-SPEC-0221 rule 3 does not withhold it.

When any related call is unresolved, or a guard blocks the decision, no
missing discriminator is named. Rule 3 then applies unchanged.

### Crediting the selected arm

When a related test call provably selects the changed arm and the same test
holds an admitted exact oracle on that call's result (the call itself as an
`assert_eq!` operand, or a `let` binding of the call that a later exact
assertion observes, as in RIPR-SPEC-0186 pairing), discrimination is
confirmed and the finding may read `exposed`. Selection replaces token
matching as the confirmation for that test.

### Selection outranks tokens

When every related call is resolved and none selects the changed arm, a
variant token in an assertion does not confirm the arm. This closes the
expected-side confirmation in Problem item 3.

### Decisions for the owner

These choices are not implied by existing specs. The recommended default is
written into the Behavior above; each can be reversed without touching the
rest.

1. **Pattern grammar.** Recommended: the list above, including ranges and
   bare imported variants. Narrower alternative: literals and qualified
   enum paths only.
2. **`_` and binding arms by first-match.** Recommended: a trailing `_` is
   selected when every earlier arm provably does not match, so a change to
   `_ => 0` with only `f(Kind::A)` (selecting `Kind::A =>`) names `_` as
   missing. Alternative: never name `_`.
3. **Mixed resolved and unresolved calls.** Recommended: any unresolved call
   blocks the "no call selects" claim (fail closed), because the unresolved
   input may select the arm. Alternative: name the arm from the resolved calls
   and disclose the unresolved ones.
4. **Selected-arm credit.** Recommended: credit (`exposed`) as written above.
   Alternative: name the selection in the discriminate summary but keep the
   existing token rule for credit.

## Required Evidence

- `fixtures/match_arm_blind` reads `weakly_exposed` with a missing
  discriminator whose `value` is `None`, on main and with RIPR-SPEC-0221
  applied.
- A selected-arm control (`assert_eq!(reason(None), 0)`) reads `exposed`.
- An unresolved-input control reads no named missing discriminator; with
  RIPR-SPEC-0221 applied it reads `static_unknown` with
  `rust_oracle_target_unresolved`.
- A guarded-arm control reads no named missing discriminator.
- The expected-side trap reads below `exposed`.
- Golden drift on the #5432 list is reviewed row by row: each finding that
  leaves `static_unknown` names its unselected arm, and none gains `exposed`
  without a selecting call and an exact oracle in one test.

## Non-Goals

- No guard evaluation.
- No scrutinee that is not a direct owner parameter (fields, method results,
  computed tuples).
- No exhaustiveness checking beyond source-order first match.
- No change to RIPR-SPEC-0164 helper transfer, which keeps its own refusals.
- No new probe family, class, `static_limit_kind` or schema field.

## Acceptance Examples

Source for 1 to 3:
`fn reason(x: Option<i32>) -> i32 { match x { Some(v) => v + 1, None => 0 } }`,
the diff changes `None => 1` to `None => 0`.

1. Test `assert_eq!(reason(Some(5)), 6)`: `weakly_exposed`; missing
   discriminator `value` `None`, reason names arm `None =>` and observed
   `Some(5)`.
2. Test `assert_eq!(reason(None), 0)`: `exposed`.
3. Test `let x = make(); assert_eq!(reason(x), 6)`: no named missing
   discriminator; `static_unknown` / `rust_oracle_target_unresolved` under
   RIPR-SPEC-0221.
4. `match k { Kind::A => 1, _ => 0 }`, change `_ => 0` to `_ => 2`, test
   `assert_eq!(f(Kind::A), 1)`: `weakly_exposed`; missing discriminator
   `value` `_`.
5. `match x { Some(v) if v > 3 => 1, _ => 0 }`, guard changed to `v > 4`,
   test `assert_eq!(f(Some(5)), 1)`: no named missing discriminator.
6. `match k { Kind::A => Kind::B, Kind::B => Kind::A }`, arm `Kind::B =>`
   changed, test `assert_eq!(f(Kind::A), Kind::B)`: `weakly_exposed`; missing
   discriminator `value` `Kind::B`.
7. `match n { 0 => "zero", 1..=9 => "digit", _ => "many" }`, arm
   `1..=9 =>` changed, tests `f(0)` and `f(42)` with exact assertions:
   `weakly_exposed`; missing discriminator `value` `1..=9`.

## Test Mapping

- `fixtures/match_arm_blind` (example 1)
- Planned: one fixture or verdict-corpus case per acceptance example 2 to 7.
- Planned: `crates/ripr/src/analysis/classify/activation.rs` unit tests for
  each grammar element, guard blocking, first-match order and unresolved
  arguments.
- Planned: a `gap_admission` test showing rule 3 keeps the gap once the arm is
  named.

## Implementation Mapping

- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/classify/activation.rs`: selection facts and the
  `match_arm` missing discriminator; keep constructors on observed values.
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/classify/reveal.rs`: selection confirmation and
  the selection-outranks-tokens gate.
- `crates/ripr/src/analysis/classify/gap_admission.rs` (#5416): no change;
  rule 3 already keeps a gap with a named missing discriminator.

## Metrics

- `match_arm_unselected_arm_named`: a `match_arm` finding whose resolved
  related calls all select other arms names the changed arm as missing.
- `match_arm_selected_arm_credit`: a resolved selecting call with a same-test
  exact oracle confirms the arm.
- Verdict-corpus false-actionable and false-silent counts on `match_arm`
  cases do not rise.
