# MCP workspace status server

`ripr mcp` serves a bounded, read-only RIPR workspace status over the
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/): newline-delimited
JSON-RPC on stdin and stdout. It tells an MCP client which repository root RIPR
would use and what RIPR is and is not allowed to do there. It does not analyze
code, name gaps, or repair anything; use `ripr check` and `ripr agent repair`
for that.

The design boundary is [ADR 0022](../adr/0022-mcp-is-a-bounded-projection.md).

## Launch

```bash
ripr mcp --stdio [--root PATH]
```

`--stdio` is the default and only transport. With `--root`, RIPR uses that
exact directory. Without it, RIPR starts at the current directory and walks up
to the nearest directory containing `.git`, falling back to the nearest one
with a project file such as `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, or `pyproject.toml`.
Either way, the chosen root must itself contain a project file: a repository
with only `.git` reports `repository_marker_missing` (#3927). Clients often start
servers outside the repository, so pass an absolute `--root` when yours does.

A generic MCP client entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ripr": {
      "command": "ripr",
      "args": ["mcp", "--stdio", "--root", "/path/to/repo"]
    }
  }
}
```

## What it exposes

| Surface | Name |
| --- | --- |
| Tool (no arguments) | `ripr_workspace_status` |
| Resource (`application/json`) | `ripr://workspace/status` |

Both return the same JSON document, schema `ripr-mcp-workspace-status-v1`,
which wraps a `ripr-workspace-status-v1` workspace block:

- `workspace_state`: `ready` or `unavailable`;
- `root`: validation `state`, `source` (`explicit`, `current_directory`,
  `ancestor_discovery`, or `unavailable`), detected repository markers, an
  `error_code` when unavailable (for example `root_missing`), and a hashed
  host-local `identity`. The absolute path is never returned;
- `configuration.project_config_state`: whether a `ripr.toml` was detected.
  It is detected, not loaded;
- `trust` and `authority`: `read_only_status` access, with source edit,
  verification execution, mutation execution, and model provider all `none`;
- `claim_boundary` and `limitations`, as plain text;
- the transport, tool, resource, and byte bounds under `mcp`.

Supported protocol versions are `2024-11-05`, `2025-03-26`, `2025-06-18`,
`2025-11-25`, and `2026-07-28`. A client can open with `initialize`, where an
unsupported requested version is answered with `2026-07-28`, or with
`server/discover`, where every request carries
`io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion` and
`io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities` in `params._meta` and an
unsupported version is refused.

## What it does not do

It does not run analysis or refresh evidence, edit source, execute verify
commands or mutation testing, load project-local configuration or providers,
embed a model, or offer a remote transport.

An invalid root does not stop the server. Status reports
`workspace_state: "unavailable"` with a `root.error_code`. Protocol errors keep
standard JSON-RPC codes, and every error response carries an `id` (`null` when
the request id is unreadable). Messages are capped at 256 KiB and responses at
128 KiB. Stdout carries only protocol messages; operational errors go to stderr,
and invalid command-line arguments exit with status 2.
