# ADR 0002: Static Exposure Language

Status: accepted

Date: 2026-05-01

## Context

`ripr` uses mutation-testing concepts but does not run mutants during normal
static analysis. Overstating static findings would mislead users and make the
tool harder to trust.

## Decision

Static findings use only conservative exposure language:

- `exposed`
- `weakly_exposed`
- `reachable_unrevealed`
- `no_static_path`
- `infection_unknown`
- `propagation_unknown`
- `static_unknown`

Static findings must not claim:

- `killed`
- `survived`
- `untested`
- `proven`
- `adequate`

Real mutation outcomes can appear only in explicit calibration output where real
mutation data is present.

## Consequences

Positive:

- preserves trust in draft-mode findings
- keeps the product distinct from mutation runners
- makes unknowns honest and actionable

Negative:

- output is less dramatic than traditional mutation testing language
- users may need calibration docs to understand where real mutation fits

## Alternatives Considered

- Reuse mutation-runtime vocabulary (`killed`, `survived`, `untested`)
  for static findings. Rejected: misleads consumers into thinking
  `ripr` ran mutants; collapses the static-vs-runtime boundary that
  calibration depends on.
- Invent entirely new vocabulary unconnected to mutation testing.
  Rejected: loses the conceptual mapping that makes RIPR evidence
  legible to mutation-testing readers and to future calibration.
