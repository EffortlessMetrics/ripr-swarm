# Review Invariants

Use these invariants during automated PR review.

## General

A finding is useful if it identifies a concrete failure mode another agent can fix.

Do not suppress concrete findings because there are many of them. Suppress only duplicates, speculation, or non-actionable comments.

## Review output invariants

Each actionable finding emitted by Droid must include:

* failure mode;
* repo invariant, policy, or edge case violated;
* fix direction (name likely files/functions when useful);
* validation (command, report, fixture, golden, or CI check);
* confidence (High / Medium / Low with justification when not high).

Use the checked-in finding packet shape:

```text
[P0|P1|P2] Short title

Failure mode:
Why here:
Fix direction:
Validation:
Confidence:
```

The comment should be useful as an inter-agent repair queue entry. It should
name the likely repair surface and preserve the repo invariant that made the
finding actionable.

Review output should not optimize for short comments at the expense of repair value. Droid runs consume CI time, model calls, and repo research; each finding should amortize that cost by preserving useful research context in the comment or summary.

Do not discard useful repo research. If Droid inspected specs, policies, CI configuration, prior comments, or in-repo documentation, preserve the relevant result so the next repair agent does not rediscover the same invariant.

## Suggested fix invariants

Use GitHub suggestion blocks for high-confidence local edits that should apply
cleanly.

Use ordered repair plans for cross-file, policy, fixture, golden,
traceability, schema, or design-dependent changes. Name likely files, tests,
policies, and generated outputs, and include validation commands.

## Evidence provenance invariants

Separate validation signal by provenance:

* `Observed:` CI checks, files, logs, or artifacts Droid directly inspected.
* `Reported:` PR-body, commit-message, or comment claims.
* `Not verified:` validation Droid did not run or observe.

Do not treat PR-body validation claims as independently verified facts.

## Clean review invariants

When no actionable findings are emitted, prefer:

```text
No actionable findings emitted.
```

The clean-review body should still name inspected surfaces, checks performed,
why no comments were emitted, residual risk, and validation signal. Validation
signal should be split into `Observed`, `Reported`, and `Not verified`.

Avoid vague residual-risk labels such as `minimal`, `low risk`, or `safe`
unless tied to concrete evidence.

## Notification invariants

Automated review output should avoid unnecessary notifications.

* Droid-generated review bodies must not @mention humans, teams, bots, or organizations unless explicitly requested.
* Review comments should be addressed to the next repair agent, not to the PR author.
* Do not write `cc @username`, `asking @username`, or `Droid finished @username's task` in Droid-generated review content.
* Avoid direct author-directed wording such as `you should`.
* Prefer PR-scoped language: `this PR`, `this diff`, `the changed code`, `the follow-up agent`, `the next repair pass`.
* Treat platform-generated wrapper mentions as outside repo guidance; do not repeat them in review content.

## Workflow invariants

For GitHub Actions:

- Workflows using secrets must not run on untrusted fork PR code.
- Do not use `pull_request_target` unless the workflow is deliberately designed for it.
- Keep `permissions:` minimal and explicit.
- Workflows that call third-party actions with secrets or write permissions should use pinned refs.
- New workflows must be represented in `policy/workflow_allowlist.txt`.
- If a workflow adds shell `run:` blocks, the workflow allowlist budget must reflect them.
- Do not print secrets or generated local settings containing expanded secrets.
- Keep full Droid output disabled unless debugging in a safe private context.
- Do not upload raw `$HOME/.factory/**` or raw `droid-prompts/**` from
  secrets-backed Droid workflows.

## Droid workflow invariants

For Droid workflows:

- Use the MiniMax BYOK model path unless intentionally changing provider.
- Model should be `custom:MiniMax-M3-0`.
- Runtime BYOK settings should be written to `~/.factory/settings.json`.
- Do not rely on the Droid Action `settings:` input for BYOK custom models unless Factory fixes the path mismatch.
- Keep `${MINIMAX_API_KEY}` literal in checked-in or artifact-prone files.
- Clear `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` and `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` with empty Droid action step `env` overrides so runner-level Anthropic globals cannot shadow the MiniMax BYOK settings.
- Keep `show_full_output: false`.
- Use the approved safe action ref
  `EffortlessMetrics/droid-action-safe@7c1377ccbacddc95560d1570547a5baa51de01ec`.
- Ensure the GitHub CLI is available on `PATH` before the Droid action starts;
  the safe action uses `gh pr checkout` while preparing PR diffs.
- Set `upload_debug_artifacts: false`.
- Do not use `Factory-AI/droid-action` directly for MiniMax BYOK workflows
  unless a future upstream SHA has an explicit debug-artifact disable input and
  the checker allowlist is updated.
- `automatic_review: true` and `automatic_security_review: true` must be set.
- `review_depth: shallow` unless intentionally changed.
- `cancel-in-progress: false` with per-PR concurrency group.
- `pull_request` types must include `opened`, `synchronize`, `ready_for_review`, `reopened`.
- Same-repo guard (`head.repo.full_name == github.repository`) is required.
- Draft PRs must not be filtered out.
- `MINIMAX_API_KEY` must be job-level env referencing `${{ secrets.MINIMAX_API_KEY }}`.
- Action refs must be immutable 40-character commit SHAs.
- The manual workflow (`droid.yml`) must have trusted actor guards (`OWNER`, `MEMBER`, `COLLABORATOR`).
- The scheduled security scan must keep `workflow_dispatch`, the weekly Monday
  08:00 UTC schedule, repo-scoped concurrency, `security_scan_schedule: true`,
  `security_scan_days: 7`, `security_severity_threshold: medium`,
  `security_block_on_critical: true`, and `security_block_on_high: false`.
- These invariants, including scheduled security-scan shape and explicit `show_full_output: false`, are enforced by `cargo xtask check-droid-review-config`.

## Queueing invariants

For automatic Droid PR review:

- Run on same-repo PRs and every commit.
- Draft PRs are reviewable.
- Do not cancel an active Droid review.
- Keep at most the latest queued review per PR.
- Allow separate PRs to run concurrently.
