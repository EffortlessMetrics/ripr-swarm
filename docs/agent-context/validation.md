# Validation Commands

Agents should use the smallest validation set that proves the change.

## Rust

```bash
cargo check --workspace --all-targets
cargo test --workspace
```

## Workflow policy

```bash
cargo xtask check-workflows
```

Run this for any change to:

- `.github/workflows/**`
- `policy/workflow_allowlist.txt`
- release workflows
- CI/security workflows

## Droid workflow policy

```bash
cargo xtask check-droid-review-config
```

Run this with `cargo xtask check-workflows` for changes to:

- `.github/workflows/droid-review.yml`
- `.github/workflows/droid.yml`
- `.github/workflows/droid-security-scan.yml`
- `docs/agent-context/review-invariants.md`
- `docs/agent-context/droid-smoke-tests.md`
- `.factory/skills/review-guidelines/SKILL.md`
- `.factory/rules/droid-review.md`

## Security-sensitive review

For changes involving secrets, workflows, dependency policy, release scripts, or command execution:

- inspect workflow permissions;
- inspect event triggers;
- inspect fork behavior;
- inspect artifact/log exposure;
- inspect whether secrets can be printed or written to repo files.
