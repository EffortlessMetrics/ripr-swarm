# ripr documentation

Start with the [Quickstart](QUICKSTART.md). It covers the ordinary CLI, VS Code,
GitHub Actions, and agent paths, including honest no-action and limited results.

## Choose a task

| Goal | Start here | What it covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inspect one change | [CLI first hour](QUICKSTART.md#cli-first-hour) | Run `ripr check`, choose the diff, and read the bounded next action. |
| Understand a finding | [Static exposure model](STATIC_EXPOSURE_MODEL.md) · [Terminology](TERMINOLOGY.md) · [Finding triage](how-to/triage-a-finding.md) | How RIPR connects changed behavior, related tests, observations, and assertions—and where static analysis stops. |
| Add one focused test | [Targeted test workflow](TARGETED_TEST_WORKFLOW.md) | Turn one supported gap into a focused test and compare before/after evidence. |
| Try RIPR on one pull request | [First successful PR workflow](FIRST_PR_WORKFLOW.md) | Run one bounded adoption loop and retain reviewer-facing evidence. |
| Work in VS Code | [Editor extension](EDITOR_EXTENSION.md) · [First run to first receipt](EDITOR_FIRST_RUN_TO_FIRST_RECEIPT.md) | Install the extension, inspect saved-workspace diagnostics, and complete one repair receipt. |
| Add advisory CI or review a PR | [CI strategy](CI.md) · [PR review guidance](PR_REVIEW_GUIDANCE.md) | Generate advisory GitHub Actions, read summaries and artifacts, and keep gate authority explicit. |
| Hand work to a coding agent | [LLM operator guide](LLM_OPERATOR_GUIDE.md) · [Agent workflows](AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md) | Give an agent a bounded packet with evidence, edit limits, verification, and stop conditions. |
| Configure RIPR or consume its output | [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md) · [Output schema](OUTPUT_SCHEMA.md) | Repository policy, CLI and editor settings, JSON contracts, and machine-readable states. |
| Check language and workflow maturity | [Support tiers](status/SUPPORT_TIERS.md) · [Language adapter preview](LANGUAGE_ADAPTER_PREVIEW.md) | What is usable, preview, advisory, unavailable, or explicitly limited. |
| Connect another client | [MCP workspace status](interop/mcp.md) · [Neovim LSP recipe](interop/neovim-lsp.md) | Read-only MCP status and a portable standard-LSP client path. |
