# Implementation Plan

This is the working PR checklist for building `ripr` incrementally. It is more
operational than the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md): each entry should become a scoped PR
with clear artifacts, tests, documentation updates, and gates.

The checklist is grouped into
[implementation campaigns](IMPLEMENTATION_CAMPAIGNS.md). A campaign may work
through multiple work items, but each work item should follow the
[scoped PR contract](SCOPED_PR_CONTRACT.md).

This file is one layer of the repo's centralized, agent-neutral tracking
model. The full layering — proposals (why), specs (what), ADRs (durable
decisions), this plan (work queue), campaign ledger, active manifest, and
closeout handoffs — is documented in the
[repo tracking model](REPO_TRACKING_MODEL.md). Reach for a proposal in
[`docs/proposals/`](proposals/) before a spec when the change spans more
than one behavior contract or touches repo shape.

| First-Hour UX (12) | Make new LSP-first and CI-first users successful without learning RIPR's internal report topology. | Complete: editor status, intent-titled actions, advisory CI summary, workflow smoke fixture, user-type docs, and `campaign/first-hour-ux-closeout`. |
| PR Review Guidance (13) | Project existing RIPR evidence into bounded pull-request review guidance without making CI blocking or turning RIPR into a free-form reviewer. | Complete: renderer, generated CI, fixtures, docs, and `campaign/pr-review-guidance-closeout`. |
| Recommendation Calibration (14) | Measure whether top CI, LSP, and PR recommendations are clear, correctly placed, low-noise, and correlated with better static evidence after one focused test. | Complete: spec, corpus, receipts, report, guide, and `campaign/recommendation-calibration-closeout`. |
| Calibrated Gate Policy (15) | Define optional calibrated gates over existing PR-time evidence without changing advisory defaults or blurring static/runtime evidence. | Complete: spec, evaluator, fixtures, generated CI opt-in wiring, evidence-preserving CI behavior, calibrated gate guide, and `campaign/calibrated-gate-closeout`. |

| RIPR Zero Adoption (17) | Turn baselines into burn-down ledgers with create, diff, and shrink-only refresh commands while keeping generated CI advisory by default. | Complete: spec, baseline create, baseline diff, shrink-only update, generated CI baseline-delta artifacts, baseline ledger workflow guide, and `campaign/ripr-zero-adoption-closeout`. |
| RIPR Zero Reporting (18) | Turn reviewed baselines and debt deltas into repo-level RIPR 0 status, stale-debt, trend, and repair-area reporting while preserving advisory defaults. | Complete: spec, baseline metadata, status report, generated CI summary, user workflow docs, and `campaign/ripr-zero-reporting-closeout`. |
| PR Evidence Ledger (19) | Turn per-PR RIPR evidence into an adoption ledger for movement history, waiver aging, baseline burn-down, repair receipts, and coverage/grip frontier signals while preserving advisory defaults. | Complete: spec, producer, generated-CI projection, coverage/grip frontier report, user workflow docs, and `campaign/pr-evidence-ledger-closeout`. |
| Test-Oracle Assistant Proof (20) | Prove the full PR-time loop from changed Rust behavior to static evidence, PR/editor guidance, focused-test handoff, verification, receipt, and advisory CI/ledger projection. | Complete: spec, canonical fixture, dogfood receipt, user workflow docs, and `campaign/test-oracle-assistant-proof-closeout`. |
| Test-Oracle Assistant Report Producer (21) | Turn the proved assistant loop into a public read-only JSON/Markdown report producer and optional advisory CI projection. | Complete: report producer, generated-CI projection, proof-report docs, and `campaign/test-oracle-assistant-report-closeout`. |
| First Useful Action (22) | Compress existing editor, PR, ledger, proof, receipt, optional gate, coverage/grip, and staleness evidence into one advisory next test action. | Complete: RIPR-SPEC-0020 defines the report contract, the routing corpus is pinned, `ripr first-action` writes the read-only advisory report, generated CI surfaces it as advisory summary/artifact content, VS Code status/Show Status project an existing report, workflow docs explain developer, reviewer, and agent use, dogfood receipts are checked, and `campaign/first-useful-action-closeout` records the final audit. |
| Assistant Loop Health (23) | Summarize proof completeness, missing inputs, static evidence movement, recurring warnings, and next repair queues across one or more assistant proof reports. | Complete: RIPR-SPEC-0022 defines the report contract, the assistant-loop-health fixture corpus is pinned, `ripr assistant-loop health` writes advisory JSON/Markdown from explicit proof inputs, generated GitHub CI uploads and summarizes health artifacts when proof artifacts exist, `docs/ASSISTANT_LOOP_HEALTH_WORKFLOW.md` explains maintainer and agent use, and `campaign/assistant-loop-health-closeout` records the final audit. |
| PR Review Front Panel (24) | Compose existing PR guidance, first useful action, assistant proof, assistant-loop health, PR evidence ledger, baseline delta, gate decision, receipts, calibration, and optional coverage/grip frontier artifacts into one advisory generated-CI first screen. | Complete: report contract, fixture corpus, `ripr pr-review front-panel`, generated-CI projection, workflow docs, dogfood receipts, and closeout audit are in place. |
| Report Packet Index (25) | Make the uploaded `ripr-reports` packet navigable as a reviewer-first index over explicit existing artifacts. | Complete: report contract, fixture corpus, `ripr reports index`, generated-CI projection, workflow docs, dogfood receipts, and closeout audit are in place. |
| PR Inline Comment Publisher (26) | Make optional durable PR comments safe and explicit by planning, capping, deduplicating, and publishing only changed-line `review-comments` entries when configured. | Complete: spec, fixture corpus, read-only publish plan, generated-CI opt-in wiring, workflow docs, dogfood receipts, and closeout audit are in place. |
| Language Adapter Preview (27) | Introduce a language-neutral analysis adapter boundary, keep Rust as the reference adapter, and add syntax-first TypeScript and Python preview adapters that feed the existing RIPR domain, output, LSP, agent, and Lane 4 surfaces without changing Rust behavior or default CI blocking. | Complete: RIPR-PROP-0001 records the adapter design intent, RIPR-SPEC-0026 pins the adapter contract, RIPR-SPEC-0027 pins the TypeScript preview static-fact contract, and RIPR-SPEC-0028 pins the Python preview static-fact contract. TypeScript and Python preview facts are fixture-backed; Lane 3 editor routing landed from RIPR-PROP-0003, RIPR-SPEC-0036, RIPR-SPEC-0037, ADR-0011, and `plans/campaign-27/lane3-editor-preview-routing.md`; generated CI language grouping projects configured preview evidence as advisory-only groups while keeping Rust defaults and gate authority unchanged; `docs/LANGUAGE_ADAPTER_PREVIEW.md` documents the adoption and rollback path; `cargo xtask dogfood` checks TypeScript/Python preview receipts for labels, static limits, disabled-language behavior, and no cross-language related-test routing; the closeout audit records the preview/advisory boundary. |
| TypeScript Enablement | Make the completed TypeScript/JavaScript preview surface more useful, precise, repair-card-shaped, and promotion-ready without reopening preview completion or changing advisory authority. | Active successor lane: [TypeScript Enablement](lanes/TYPESCRIPT_ENABLEMENT.md) records that preview completion is closed and future TypeScript work should focus on weak-oracle guidance, false-actionable audits, narrow mock/error payload support, bounded method receiver relation follow-ons, module initializer guidance, repair-card projection, dogfood, route quality, and an explicit remain-preview or promotion decision. |
| Python Repair Routing (28) | Turn changed Python behavior into bounded test-repair work with project detection, repair cards, verify commands, agent packets, and outcome receipts while keeping broader Python static facts preview/advisory outside the scoped repair-routing support tier. | Active: [RIPR-PROP-0017](proposals/RIPR-PROP-0017-python-repair-routing-lane.md) and [the Python repair-routing plan](../plans/python-repair-routing/implementation-plan.md) define the staged lane. The current slice makes Python before/after receipt evidence and noise-control fixtures fixture-backed: repair cards already project to GapRecords, agent packets, queue items, verify commands, and receipt commands; `ripr swarm ingest` has a Python preview fixture for a test-only closed attempt; `first_successful_pr/python-preview-gap` pins `ripr outcome` JSON/Markdown receipts where the canonical Python gap closes, stays unchanged, opens, strengthens, or weakens across check-output snapshots; `first_successful_pr/python-return-gap`, `python-exception-gap`, `python-field-gap`, and `python-output-gap` pin non-boundary closure from broad to exact evidence; generated Python diffs such as `*_pb2.py`, dynamic import calls such as `importlib.import_module(...)`, decorator indirection, monkeypatch/module patches, unresolved fixtures, property-based tests, opaque custom helpers, and metaclass declarations are pinned as fail-closed limitations or exclusions rather than repair-ready gaps; same-line returned-dict return/field/string signals collapse to one user-facing canonical gap; `fixtures/real-repair-attempts/corpus.json` records a repo-local Python packet that edits only tests, passes verify evidence, and closes the canonical Python gap through an outcome receipt; `fixtures/python-real-repo-evals/corpus.json` records tiny controlled pytest, no-config pyproject project detection, normal pytest app, external-repo-style `src/` package layout, CLI/output pytest, API status-code, mixed Rust/Python, and decorated route evals with Python repair cards, focused verify passes, closed outcome receipts, plus no-related-test, already-observed, and heuristic-only ordinary no-action evals with no repair card, no packet, and no receipt movement; the application-useful HTTP, CLI/output, parameterized boundary, existing-test strengthening, and model-field slices are fixture-backed; the scoped support-tier review promotes only the Python repair-routing loop to usable alpha; broader Python static facts remain preview/advisory, and `dogfood/python-stability-evals-v1` is the next checkpoint before any stable-support consideration. |
| Policy Readiness and Preview Evidence Governance (Lane 2 tracker) | Make policy decisions auditable across stable Rust evidence and preview-language evidence without changing advisory defaults. | Complete: tracker [#755](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/ripr/issues/755), readiness reporting, preview evidence policy, waiver aging, suppression health, baseline refresh guardrails, exception ledger convergence, blocking guidance, advisory CI projection, and [closeout audit](handoffs/2026-05-12-policy-readiness-closeout.md) are in place. |
| Policy Operations and Promotion Readiness (Lane 2 tracker) | Make policy adoption operational with current safe ceiling, next safe action, blockers to stricter modes, policy history, and read-only promotion packets. | Complete: [Policy operations](policy/POLICY_OPERATIONS.md) and `.ripr/goals/lane2-policy-operations.toml` define the closed focused tracker. RIPR-SPEC-0039 defines the policy operations report contract, `ripr policy operations` writes the first operator packet, RIPR-SPEC-0041 defines policy history trends, `ripr policy history` writes the advisory trend packet, RIPR-SPEC-0042 defines manual-review promotion packets, `ripr policy promote --to ...` writes those packets, RIPR-SPEC-0044 defines default-blocked preview evidence promotion packets, `ripr policy preview-promote` writes preview evidence promotion packets, [Policy operations workflow](POLICY_OPERATIONS_WORKFLOW.md) documents maintainer use, generated CI surfaces operations, history, promotion, and configured preview-promotion artifacts as advisory-only packets, and [closeout audit](handoffs/2026-05-13-policy-operations-closeout.md) records the final Lane 2 boundary. |
| Generated Evidence Discipline (repo operations lane) | Make generated evidence, authored truth, deterministic repair, judgment-required decisions, and review receipts mechanically distinct for agentic development. | Complete: badge endpoint ownership, generated-clean checks, worktree doctor, PR triage, PR status, spec numbering, campaign checks, command mutability catalog, existing receipts/critic surfaces, suggested fixes, contributor docs, `pr-ready`, repo `cockpit`, repo-ops report indexing, merge-watch policy, queue disposition, and [closeout audits](handoffs/2026-05-14-generated-evidence-discipline-closeout.md) / [Repo-Ops UX cockpit closeout](handoffs/2026-05-16-repo-ops-ux-cockpit-closeout.md) are in place. |
| Evidence Quality Leadership (Lane 1 tracker) | Make analyzer evidence self-aware about quality, proof, calibration, unknowns, and next repair. | Complete: scorecard, benchmark corpus, static limitation taxonomy, oracle semantics audit fix, runtime-fixtures-v3, evidence-quality trend, capability metadata, traceability, and [closeout audit](handoffs/2026-05-13-lane-1-evidence-quality-leadership-closeout.md) are in place. Future Lane 1 work opens only for a new measured evidence class or contract change. |
| User-Visible Output Evidence (Lane 1 tracker) | Make changed presentation/help/report/table text one evidence-quality-aware action, no-action state, or static limitation. | Complete: [RIPR-PROP-0005](proposals/RIPR-PROP-0005-user-visible-output-evidence.md), [RIPR-SPEC-0043](specs/RIPR-SPEC-0043-presentation-text-evidence.md), [RIPR-SPEC-0045](specs/RIPR-SPEC-0045-finding-to-gap-alignment.md), and [the lane tracker](lanes/LANE_1_USER_VISIBLE_OUTPUT_EVIDENCE.md) define the source-of-truth stack. Finding-alignment benchmarks are pinned, `evidence_record` carries additive `raw_findings[]`, `canonical_item`, and nullable `presentation_text` fields, `ripr check --json` groups supported presentation-text declaration plus adjacent literal raw findings into one canonical item, fixture-backed visibility/observer/actionability states are implemented for help/report/internal text, scorecard/trend output reports raw-to-canonical and presentation-text quality counts, the downstream consumer handoff is merged, and the [closeout audit](handoffs/2026-05-14-user-visible-output-evidence-closeout.md) records proof, remaining unknowns, and downstream boundaries. |
| Finding Alignment Burn-Down (Lane 1 tracker) | Keep the raw-finding to canonical-item to actionable-gap model useful as new gaps are measured. | Complete: [Lane 1 Finding Alignment Burn-Down](lanes/LANE_1_FINDING_ALIGNMENT_BURNDOWN.md), [the implementation plan](../plans/lane1-finding-alignment-burndown/implementation-plan.md), and [the closeout handoff](handoffs/2026-05-22-lane1-finding-alignment-burndown-closeout.md) record the issue-backed queue, improved evidence classes, moved counts, remaining limits, and audit-driven next-class selection rule. |
| Value Resolution Audit Fixes (Lane 1 tracker) | Burn down one fixture-backed `predicate_boundary` / `activation_value_unresolved` sub-shape from current audit and scorecard proof. | Complete: [Lane 1 Value Resolution Audit Fixes](lanes/LANE_1_VALUE_RESOLUTION_AUDIT_FIXES.md), [the implementation plan](../plans/lane1-value-resolution-audit-fixes/implementation-plan.md), and [the closeout handoff](handoffs/2026-05-23-lane1-value-resolution-audit-fixes-closeout.md) record the issue-backed queue, fixture-first selection, already-supported analyzer disposition, zero-movement audit delta, dogfood receipt, remaining limitations, and no selected successor. |
| Target-Affinity Owner-Call Tracing (Lane 1 follow-up) | Burn down measured `activation_owner_call_absent_*_target_affinity` routes by adding fixture-backed owner-call tracing while preserving advisory/static-limitation boundaries. | Active: `analysis/call-presence-target-affinity-owner-call-tracing` remains the top sampled work queue. The current scoped PR extends direct same-package multi-owner production-wrapper tracing to value-insensitive assertion-target affinity, same-file unit-test wrapper calls, crate-local module-alias wrapper calls, crate-local direct imported-owner calls, package-local explicit crate-qualified owner calls, and file-scope direct-imported indexed support-helper calls, and it keeps call-presence assertion-target matching on extracted callee names rather than argument/context tokens from full call expressions; bare/external aliases, test-local shadows, ambiguous imported owner names, cross-package crate-qualified paths, other-owner helper imports, block-local helper imports, other-target affinity, and bare qualified paths stay limited, predicate-boundary value checks stay excluded, and no observed values are invented. |
| Editor Evidence UX (future) | Make the saved-workspace LSP path feel like an editor-native test-intent cockpit from diagnostic to hover, related test, context packet, one test, verify, and receipt. | Complete as an explicit parallel Lane 3 closeout: contract audit, hover hardening, evidence-aware actions, context packet, protocol smoke, VS Code smoke, status/staleness, workflow docs, and closeout audit. |
| Editor First-Run and Repair Usability (Lane 3 tracker) | Make the existing editor cockpit self-orienting from setup diagnosis to one bounded repair packet, verify command, receipt visibility, and refresh. | Complete: [RIPR-PROP-0008](proposals/RIPR-PROP-0008-editor-first-run-usability.md), [RIPR-SPEC-0049](specs/RIPR-SPEC-0049-editor-setup-status.md), [RIPR-SPEC-0050](specs/RIPR-SPEC-0050-editor-first-repair-loop.md), [ADR-0013](adr/0013-editor-setup-diagnostics-are-read-only.md), and [the implementation plan](../plans/editor-first-run-usability/implementation-plan.md) define the closed Lane 3 stack. #1012 through #1040 added setup diagnosis, first-run/no-output smoke, receipt visibility, first-repair packets, first-run fixtures, user docs, dogfood receipts, and [closeout proof](handoffs/2026-05-16-editor-first-run-usability-closeout.md). |
| Editor First-PR Bridge (Lane 3 tracker) | Connect the editor repair loop to the existing first-pr start-here packet without making Lane 3 a PR/CI producer. | Complete: [RIPR-PROP-0010](proposals/RIPR-PROP-0010-editor-first-pr-bridge.md), [RIPR-SPEC-0052](specs/RIPR-SPEC-0052-editor-first-pr-packet-projection.md), [ADR-0014](adr/0014-editor-first-pr-projection-is-read-only.md), and [the implementation plan](../plans/editor-first-pr-bridge/implementation-plan.md) define the closed Lane 3 stack. #1098 through #1116 added first-pr packet validation, status projection, bounded actions, fixtures, VS Code smoke, workflow docs, and dogfood receipts; the closeout proof is recorded in [the Editor First-PR Bridge closeout](handoffs/2026-05-17-editor-first-pr-bridge-closeout.md). |
| Start-Here Surface Convergence | Make PR/CI, CLI, editor handoffs, receipts, no-output states, preview promotion criteria, and dogfood receipts lead with the same canonical gap-to-repair unit. | Complete: [RIPR-PROP-0011](proposals/RIPR-PROP-0011-start-here-surface-convergence.md), [RIPR-SPEC-0053](specs/RIPR-SPEC-0053-start-here-surface-convergence.md), [ADR-0015](adr/0015-start-here-surfaces-use-canonical-gap-records.md), [the implementation plan](../plans/start-here-surface-convergence/implementation-plan.md), dogfood receipts, and [the closeout audit](handoffs/2026-05-22-start-here-surface-convergence-closeout.md) are in place. The active manifest later selected and closed Finding Alignment Burn-Down and Value Resolution Audit Fixes; `.ripr/goals/active.toml` now records `no_current_goal = true` with no successor selected. |
| Editor Adoption Assurance (Lane 3 tracker) | Make first-use editor setup, compatibility, root selection, multi-root, receipt mismatch, and first-pr packet mismatch states safe and legible. | Complete: [RIPR-PROP-0012](proposals/RIPR-PROP-0012-editor-adoption-assurance.md), [RIPR-SPEC-0054](specs/RIPR-SPEC-0054-editor-adoption-assurance.md), [ADR-0016](adr/0016-editor-adoption-assurance-remains-read-only.md), and [the implementation plan](../plans/editor-adoption-assurance/implementation-plan.md) define the closed Lane 3 adoption-assurance stack. Setup/root diagnosis, fixtures, VS Code smoke, install-to-first-pr docs, external-style dogfood, and [closeout proof](handoffs/2026-05-19-editor-adoption-assurance-closeout.md) are in place. |
| Editor Actionable Gap Queue (Lane 3 tracker) | Project existing actionable-gap artifacts into the editor as a bounded local repair queue. | Complete: [RIPR-PROP-0013](proposals/RIPR-PROP-0013-editor-actionable-gap-queue.md), [RIPR-SPEC-0055](specs/RIPR-SPEC-0055-editor-actionable-gap-queue.md), [ADR-0017](adr/0017-editor-gap-queue-is-read-only.md), and [the implementation plan](../plans/editor-actionable-gap-queue/implementation-plan.md) define the closed stack. Validation, Show Status queue projection, Copy Current Repair Packet, Copy Repo Gap Map, fixtures, VS Code smoke, [workflow docs](EDITOR_ACTIONABLE_GAP_QUEUE.md), dogfood receipts, and [closeout proof](handoffs/2026-05-20-editor-actionable-gap-queue-closeout.md) are in place. |
| Actionable Surface Translation | Make badge, PR, editor, swarm dry-run, and outcome/trend first screens translate existing actionable canonical gap evidence into the same repair-first user questions. | Complete: [RIPR-PROP-0016](proposals/RIPR-PROP-0016-actionable-surface-translation.md), [RIPR-SPEC-0059](specs/RIPR-SPEC-0059-actionable-surface-translation.md), [RIPR-PLAN-0059](../plans/actionable-surface-translation/implementation-plan.md), and [the closeout handoff](handoffs/2026-05-23-actionable-surface-translation-closeout.md) record the accepted source-of-truth stack, badge/PR/editor/swarm/outcome first-screen proof, advisory claim boundary, and no selected successor. |
| First Useful PR Loop Continuation | Make one changed Rust behavior become one clear repairable gap, one focused proof intent, one verification command, and one reviewer- and agent-readable receipt. | Complete: the goal-freshness guardrail, first-pr front door, one-screen recommendation contract, reviewer-native outcome, first-pr demo story, generated CI/VS Code/agent packet convergence, and [closeout handoff](handoffs/2026-05-23-first-useful-pr-loop-continuation-closeout.md) are in place. `.ripr/goals/active.toml` now records `no_current_goal = true` with no successor selected. |
| Self-Hosted Routed Runner Proof | Prove the CX53/CX43 self-hosted routed Rust path for the active swarm trunk, or keep the runner image-readiness/visibility blocker explicit while hosted fallback remains healthy. | Complete: [Self-hosted routed runner proof closeout](handoffs/2026-06-03-self-hosted-routed-runner-proof-closeout.md) records CX53/CX43 routed proof, #24/#34 issue-ledger updates, unchanged branch-protection boundary, and remaining non-goal follow-ups. |
| Lane 1 Real-Repo Trust Readiness | Make the evidence-to-repair foundation honest on large repositories, cross-language test suites, binding/FFI seams, and review-comment navigation. | Complete: [Lane 1 Real-Repo Trust Readiness closeout](handoffs/2026-06-03-lane1-real-repo-trust-readiness-closeout.md) records the post-0.8 issue-batch slices through #931, the no-0.8.0-tag claim boundary, and the remaining scalable-cache, cross-language oracle graph, and language-aware placement follow-ups. |
| Lane 1 Large-Repo Runtime Completeness | Make large-repo repo-exposure warm paths usable without representing limited or sampled input as full truth. | Active: `.ripr/goals/active.toml` selects #909; sharded cache storage and cache report shard summaries are done, with the diff-scoped large-repo review fast path now ready. |

The current machine-readable execution manifest is `.ripr/goals/active.toml`;
it currently records `status = "active"` for
`lane1-large-repo-runtime-completeness`. That successor campaign is scoped to
[#909](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/ripr-swarm/issues/909): make the
full classified seam cache usable for large repo-exposure warm paths by writing
bounded shard files, keeping corrupt or incomplete shard sets fail-closed, and
surfacing cache-report shard summaries. Diff-scoped large-repo review runtime
remains the next ready follow-up. The preceding
`lane1-real-repo-trust-readiness` closeout records that #913, #912, and the
post-0.8 issue-batch slices landed through #931 while #909, #908, #910, and
#911 remain broader follow-up routes rather than completed scalability or full
cross-language oracle support. Live repo handoff state says 0.8.0 has already
been published, so this successor lane remains post-release trust debt and must
not be represented as behavior included in the published tag. The goal-freshness guardrail is pinned,
the first-pr front-door stdout behavior landed in #332, the one-screen
recommendation contract landed in #335, reviewer-native outcome claim
boundaries landed in #338, the fixture-backed first successful PR demo story
landed in #341, and generated CI, VS Code, and agent packet convergence landed
in #344. The
focused Lane 2 policy readiness tracker lives in
`.ripr/goals/lane2-policy-readiness.toml` and
[Policy readiness](policy/POLICY_READINESS.md); it is a GitHub issue/PR board,
not the active execution manifest. The next focused Lane 2 tracker lives in
`.ripr/goals/lane2-policy-operations.toml` and
[Policy operations](policy/POLICY_OPERATIONS.md); it is also not the active
execution manifest. Campaigns 1 through 8 are complete.
Campaign 6 closed after the internal module SRP chain
landed through #405 while preserving the saved-workspace LSP cockpit contract,
output schemas, public API, SARIF, and badge behavior. Campaign 7 closed after
the defaults-first CLI, editor, CI, fixture, release, and report surfaces were
verified; the closeout audit lives at
`docs/handoffs/2026-05-07-campaign-7-closeout.md`. Campaign 8 added the checked
`fixtures/boundary_gap/calibration/runtime-fixtures-v1/` sample for the main
static/runtime agreement buckets and closed with runtime calibration still
confined to supplied-data reports. Campaign 9 measured the cache/editor proof
surfaces, added bounded latency reporting, reused warm-path facts below rendered
outputs, bounded `ripr pilot`, improved first-screen pilot clarity, added
evidence progress tracing, and closed after hot-path evidence indexes made the
default latency report pass on cache hits. Campaign 10 closed after aligning
the saved-workspace editor and agent CLI loop through diagnostics, evidence,
packet/brief commands, focused-test receipts, cockpit status, generated CI
artifacts, and release-readiness proof. Campaign 11 closed after adding a
read-only `ripr agent status` lens over existing agent-loop artifacts,
centralized command templates for CLI, LSP, cockpit, generated CI, docs, and
fixtures, source-edit-free workflow manifests, provenance-backed receipts,
bounded next-action guidance, review summaries, a fixture matrix, generated CI
work-loop packet uploads, and the LLM operator guide. Campaign 12 closed the
First-Hour UX lane after the LLM work-loop control plane: the PR guidance
annotation contract is pinned, the extension has a first-run status path,
diagnostic actions are titled around user intent, and the generated GitHub
workflow now writes a reviewer-oriented advisory summary before artifact
download. The generated workflow smoke fixture pins artifact paths,
top-seam extraction, agent artifacts, optional SARIF gates, badges, summary
sections, and PR guidance annotation hooks. The first-hour docs route
users by VS Code, CI, CLI, and agent/reviewer path. Campaign 13 closed PR
Review Guidance: `ripr review-comments` now produces the advisory JSON and
Markdown report, generated CI runs it before the existing summary and
annotation consumer steps, placement and suppression fixtures are pinned, and
[PR review guidance](PR_REVIEW_GUIDANCE.md) documents the bounded advisory
workflow. Campaign 14 closed Recommendation Calibration: RIPR-SPEC-0013 pins
the recommendation calibration report contract, the PR-shaped calibration
corpus plus local outcome receipts are checked, `cargo xtask
recommendation-calibration` emits the advisory report, and [Recommendation
calibration](RECOMMENDATION_CALIBRATION.md) documents how to read metrics,
receipts, placement quality, suppression correctness, static movement buckets,
and advisory limits. Campaign 15 closed the Calibrated Gate Policy lane:
RIPR-SPEC-0014 pins optional gates as explicit policy over measured evidence,
with advisory defaults, visible acknowledgement paths, and runtime mutation
calibration only as imported confidence evidence. `gate/policy-evaluator` is
implemented as a read-only report producer; `fixtures/calibrated-gate-cases`
pins the decision matrix; generated GitHub workflows now run gate evaluation
only when `RIPR_GATE_MODE` is explicitly configured; and
[Calibrated gate policy](CALIBRATED_GATE_POLICY.md) documents modes, waivers,
CI behavior, calibration evidence, and the static/runtime boundary. The
closeout handoff records the PR chain, prompt-to-artifact audit, and explicit
boundary that adoption should be opened explicitly after closeout. Campaign 16
closed Gate Adoption UX after making explicit gate adoption safe and reviewable
without changing advisory defaults. It added copyable generated-CI examples for
default advisory, `visible-only`, `acknowledgeable`, `baseline-check`, and
`calibrated-gate` modes; documented `ripr-waive` as visible acknowledgement
rather than suppression; documented baseline creation and shrink refreshes as
a visible historical-debt workflow; polished generated CI summaries for gate
mode, status, labels, waiver, baseline, calibration, blocking reason, and
artifact paths; recorded checked repo-local gate adoption receipts through
`cargo xtask dogfood`; and added [RIPR blocking
readiness](BLOCKING_READINESS.md) for deciding when to stay advisory, require
acknowledgement, use baseline-check, or enable calibrated blocking. The
[Campaign 16 closeout](handoffs/2026-05-08-campaign-16-closeout.md) records
the PR chain and proof commands. Campaign 17 closed RIPR Zero
Adoption: RIPR-SPEC-0016 defines the baseline debt delta report contract,
`ripr baseline create` can write reviewed baseline ledgers, `ripr baseline
diff` can report baseline debt movement, and `ripr baseline update
--remove-resolved` can shrink reviewed baselines without adopting new current
debt. Generated CI can now upload and summarize baseline debt delta artifacts
when a baseline and gate decision are present; the baseline ledger workflow
guide now documents initial adoption, baseline-check rollout, shrink-only
refresh, new debt review, and the path toward RIPR 0. The
[Campaign 17 closeout](handoffs/2026-05-09-campaign-17-closeout.md) records
the PR chain, prompt-to-artifact audit, proof commands, and next-work boundary.
Campaign 18 closed as RIPR Zero Reporting. RIPR-SPEC-0017 defines the
repo-level status surface for baseline owner/reason/age metadata, stale
warnings, trends, top debt areas, and repair routing. Baseline metadata
preservation, the read-only RIPR Zero status report, generated-CI summary
projection, and the user workflow docs are in place. The
[Campaign 18 closeout](handoffs/2026-05-09-campaign-18-closeout.md) records
the PR chain, proof commands, and boundary that progress toward RIPR 0 remains
separate from analyzer identity, gate policy, and advisory defaults.
Editor Evidence UX closed as a separate Lane 3 campaign; its contract audit is
recorded in [Editor Evidence UX](EDITOR_EVIDENCE_UX.md), the user path is
documented in the [editor evidence workflow](EDITOR_EVIDENCE_WORKFLOW.md), and
the [closeout handoff](handoffs/2026-05-09-editor-evidence-ux-closeout.md)
records the prompt-to-artifact audit. Future editor work should be opened as a
new explicit campaign.
Campaign 19 closed as PR Evidence Ledger. It made append-only per-PR movement
records, waiver aging, baseline burn-down, repair receipts, and optional
coverage/grip frontier signals visible without changing advisory defaults.
RIPR-SPEC-0018 pins the contract; `ripr pr-ledger record` writes the read-only
ledger; generated CI uploads `pr-evidence-ledger.{json,md}` and appends the
advisory PR movement card; `ripr coverage-grip frontier` keeps coverage and
behavioral grip movement separate; and
`docs/PR_EVIDENCE_LEDGER_WORKFLOW.md` explains the adoption workflow. Campaign
20 closed as Test-Oracle Assistant Proof. RIPR-SPEC-0019 defines the
end-to-end proof contract from changed Rust behavior through static evidence,
PR/editor guidance, focused-test handoff, verification, receipt, and advisory
CI/ledger projection without changing analyzer, policy, editor, or CI defaults.
The canonical boundary-gap replay corpus pins one seam across recommendation,
handoff, receipt, and ledger projection. The repo-local dogfood receipt traces
seam `67fc764ba37d77bd` through PR guidance, editor/agent handoff,
before/after evidence, receipt, PR ledger projection, and coverage/grip
frontier availability. `docs/TEST_ORACLE_ASSISTANT_WORKFLOW.md` explains the
user-facing PR/editor-to-receipt workflow and static evidence limits. The
[Campaign 20 closeout](handoffs/2026-05-09-campaign-20-closeout.md) records
the prompt-to-artifact audit, proof commands, and boundary that future proof
report producers, PR/CI polish, analyzer improvements, and editor UX work
should be opened as explicit follow-up campaigns. Campaign 21 closed as
Test-Oracle Assistant Report Producer. `ripr assistant-loop proof` now produces
advisory `test-oracle-assistant-proof.{json,md}` artifacts from explicit
existing inputs without changing analyzer, ranking, gate, editor, provider,
mutation, or default CI behavior. Generated GitHub CI now projects that report
only when the required artifact chain already exists.
`docs/TEST_ORACLE_ASSISTANT_PROOF_REPORT.md` now explains how to read the
report, warnings, static movement, optional CI projection, and limits. Campaign
21 closed with
`docs/handoffs/2026-05-09-campaign-21-closeout.md`. Campaign 22 closed as
First Useful Action. It compresses existing evidence into one advisory next
test action; RIPR-SPEC-0020 pins the report contract, the routing corpus pins
expected statuses and fallback outputs, `ripr first-action` writes the
read-only report from explicit artifacts, generated CI projects it as advisory
summary/artifact content, and VS Code status projects existing reports without
rerunning analysis. The first-action workflow docs explain how developers,
reviewers, and coding agents read the action, verify movement, emit receipts,
and interpret fallback states. `cargo xtask dogfood` checks repo-local
first-action receipts for actionable, baseline-only, stale,
missing-required-artifact, unchanged-after-attempt, and no-actionable-seam
routes. The
[Campaign 22 closeout](handoffs/2026-05-09-campaign-22-closeout.md) records
the prompt-to-artifact audit, validation commands, and boundary that future
health, analyzer, policy, or editor lanes need explicit follow-up campaigns.

Campaign 23 closed as Assistant Loop Health. It uses the
[Assistant Loop Health proposal](ASSISTANT_LOOP_HEALTH_PROPOSAL.md) as its
design brief, [RIPR-SPEC-0022](specs/RIPR-SPEC-0022-assistant-loop-health-report.md)
defines the report contract, and the
`fixtures/boundary_gap/expected/assistant-loop-health/` corpus pins the health
states. The producer, generated-CI projection, and
[assistant loop health workflow](ASSISTANT_LOOP_HEALTH_WORKFLOW.md) are in
place. The [Campaign 23 closeout](handoffs/2026-05-09-campaign-23-closeout.md)
records the audit and future-lane boundary. The campaign measures whether
assistant proof packets are complete, stuck, missing receipts, or moving static
evidence over time, without changing analyzer behavior, ranking, gate
semantics, LSP/editor behavior, mutation execution, provider calls, source
files, generated tests, or default CI blocking.

Campaign 24 is now closed as PR Review Front Panel. It uses the
[PR Review Front Panel proposal](PR_REVIEW_FRONT_PANEL_PROPOSAL.md) as its
design brief, and
[RIPR-SPEC-0023](specs/RIPR-SPEC-0023-pr-review-front-panel-report.md) now
defines the report contract. The boundary-gap fixture corpus now pins the
advisory-only, actionable, summary-only, acknowledged, suppressed,
baseline-resolved, blocked, missing-proof, and coverage-flat-grip-improved
routes. `ripr pr-review front-panel` now writes the advisory JSON/Markdown
report from explicit existing artifact paths. Generated GitHub CI now runs the
front-panel producer only when explicit input artifacts exist, uploads
`pr-review-front-panel.{json,md}` with the normal report packet, and appends the
front-panel Markdown and at-a-glance fields to the advisory job summary while
leaving `ripr gate evaluate` as the only explicit pass/fail authority. The
[PR review front panel workflow](PR_REVIEW_FRONT_PANEL_WORKFLOW.md) now
documents how reviewers, maintainers, developers, and coding agents use the
panel, repair routes, receipts, and advisory gate boundary. The
dogfood report now checks repo-local front-panel receipts for actionable,
acknowledged, suppressed, baseline-resolved, blocked, missing-proof,
no-actionable, and coverage-flat-grip-improved reviewer states. The
campaign composes existing PR guidance, first useful action, assistant proof,
assistant-loop health, PR evidence ledger, baseline delta, gate decision,
receipts, calibration, and optional coverage/grip frontier artifacts into one
advisory GitHub PR first screen without changing analyzer behavior,
recommendation ranking, gate semantics, editor behavior, mutation execution,
provider calls, source files, generated tests, inline-comment defaults, or
default CI blocking. The
[Campaign 24 closeout](handoffs/2026-05-10-campaign-24-closeout.md) records the
PR chain, prompt-to-artifact audit, validation plan, and future-lane boundary.

Campaign 25 closed as Report Packet Index. It used the
[Report Packet Index proposal](REPORT_PACKET_INDEX_PROPOSAL.md) as its design
brief. The campaign made `target/ripr/reports/index.{json,md}` the
reviewer front door for the uploaded `ripr-reports` packet, grouping explicit
existing artifacts by start-here, PR review story, repair or agent handoff,
evidence, policy or gates, calibration, validation receipts, and SARIF or badge
outputs. It stayed advisory and read-only: no analyzer behavior,
recommendation ranking, gate semantics, editor behavior, mutation execution,
provider calls, source edits, generated tests, inline-comment defaults, hidden
analysis reruns, or default CI blocking. The fixture corpus now pins complete,
sparse, missing-front-panel, blocked-gate, missing-proof, missing-receipt, and
coverage/grip-present packet states. `ripr reports index` now writes the
read-only `target/ripr/reports/index.{json,md}` producer output from explicit
artifact directories. Generated GitHub CI now runs that producer when indexed
artifacts exist, uploads `index.{json,md}` with the report packet, and appends
the advisory packet-index summary without changing gate authority. The
[report packet index workflow](REPORT_PACKET_INDEX_WORKFLOW.md) now explains
how reviewers, maintainers, developers, and coding agents use the index.
`cargo xtask dogfood` now checks the repo-local report-packet index receipts
for complete, sparse, missing-front-panel, blocked-gate, missing-proof,
missing-receipts, and coverage/grip-present cases. The
[Campaign 25 closeout](handoffs/2026-05-10-campaign-25-closeout.md) records
the PR chain, prompt-to-artifact audit, validation plan, advisory boundary, and
future-lane boundary.

Campaign 26 is closed as PR Inline Comment Publisher. It used the
[PR Inline Comment Publisher proposal](PR_INLINE_COMMENT_PUBLISHER_PROPOSAL.md)
and [RIPR-SPEC-0025](specs/RIPR-SPEC-0025-pr-inline-comment-publisher.md) as
its design contract. The campaign made optional durable PR comments safe
by adding a read-only publish plan over existing `ripr review-comments`
artifacts before anything posts to GitHub. It must stay explicit opt-in and
advisory: no analyzer behavior, recommendation ranking, gate semantics, editor
behavior, mutation execution, provider calls, source edits, generated tests,
branch-protection changes, hidden analysis reruns, `pull_request_target`
defaults, or default CI blocking. The fixture corpus under
`fixtures/boundary_gap/expected/pr-inline-comment-publisher/` now pins the
publishable, summary-only, capped, dedupe/upsert, stale-existing, fork or
no-token, and missing-input cases. `ripr pr-comments plan` now writes the
read-only JSON/Markdown publish plan from those explicit inputs without
posting to GitHub or changing gate authority. Generated GitHub CI now keeps
inline comments disabled by default, emits publish-plan artifacts only in
opt-in modes, and posts or updates comments only when `RIPR_COMMENT_MODE=inline`
and the safe plan permits it. `docs/PR_INLINE_COMMENT_PUBLISHER_WORKFLOW.md`
now documents the opt-in workflow, plan review, fork and permission behavior,
dedupe/upsert, rollback, and advisory gate boundary. `cargo xtask dogfood` now
checks repo-local publish-plan receipts without posting real PR comments.
Campaign 26 is closed by
`docs/handoffs/2026-05-10-campaign-26-closeout.md`.
