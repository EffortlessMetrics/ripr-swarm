# PR Review Guidance

RIPR PR review guidance projects existing static seam evidence into a pull
request surface. It is meant to answer one narrow review question:

```text
For the changed behavior in this PR, which focused test would most improve the
static evidence, and what command verifies the before/after movement?
```

It is not a free-form code reviewer. It does not edit source files, generate
tests, run mutation testing, claim runtime confirmation, or make CI blocking by
default.

## Command

Run the pure report producer with an explicit base and head:

```bash
ripr review-comments \
  --root . \
  --base origin/main \
  --head HEAD \
  --out target/ripr/review/comments.json
```

The command writes:

```text
target/ripr/review/comments.json
target/ripr/review/comments.md
```

The command reads the pull request diff and existing RIPR evidence, then writes
bounded JSON and Markdown. It does not post to GitHub.

When a gap decision ledger already exists, the same command can render from the
explicit repair-card layer instead of rerunning analysis:

```bash
ripr review-comments \
  --root . \
  --base origin/main \
  --head HEAD \
  --gap-ledger target/ripr/reports/gap-decision-ledger.json \
  --out target/ripr/review/comments.json
```

In this mode, `comments[]` is limited to `GapRecord` entries that are
`projection_eligibility.pr_comment` eligible, PR-local, repairable, anchored,
deduped, and carrying verification commands. Non-eligible, duplicate, waived,
suppressed, resolved, or incomplete records stay visible in `suppressed[]`
rather than becoming line comments.

## What Reviewers See

The JSON separates recommendations by review placement:

- `comments[]` contains guidance that can safely attach to a changed line.
- `summary_only[]` contains useful guidance without a safe changed-line target.
- `suppressed[]` records candidates hidden by caps, nearby changed tests,
  configured severity, suppression policy, or missing guidance.
- `warnings[]` carries bounded selection warnings from the agent brief path.

Each line-placeable item carries the seam ID or gap ID, severity, static reason,
missing discriminator when known, suggested test shape, and bounded LLM handoff
command. Gap-ledger items also carry `repair_card`, which names the gap kind,
repair route, evidence IDs, verification command, source artifact, and authority
boundary. Downstream inline-comment publishers should use `repair_card` text
when present instead of exposing raw static classes.

## Placement Rules

RIPR only attaches line guidance to changed lines. Placement falls through in
this order:

1. exact changed seam line;
2. nearest changed line in the same owner function;
3. nearest changed line in the same file;
4. summary-only guidance when no safe changed-line placement exists.

Bad placement is worse than no placement. If a seam cannot be tied to a changed
line, reviewers should see it in the summary rather than on an unrelated line.

## Generated CI Behavior

`ripr init --ci github` generates an advisory workflow that runs
`ripr review-comments` on pull requests before the existing RIPR advisory
summary and annotation consumer steps. The generated workflow:

- writes `target/ripr/review/comments.json` and `comments.md`;
- appends PR guidance counts and summary content to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`;
- emits non-blocking GitHub check annotations from `comments[]`;
- uploads `target/ripr/review/` with the rest of the RIPR artifact packet;
- continues on error by default.

The generated workflow does not post inline PR review comments by default.
Inline review comments create durable review-thread noise and remain opt-in
through `RIPR_COMMENT_MODE`. See
[PR inline comment publisher workflow](PR_INLINE_COMMENT_PUBLISHER_WORKFLOW.md)
before enabling `plan` or `inline` mode.

## Inline Comment Boundary

If a repository builds its own inline review-comment publisher, it must be an
explicit opt-in outside the pure `ripr review-comments` command. The generated
publisher follows this same opt-in boundary through `RIPR_COMMENT_MODE` and the
[PR inline comment publisher workflow](PR_INLINE_COMMENT_PUBLISHER_WORKFLOW.md).
Any publisher must preserve the RIPR-SPEC-0012 boundaries and the
[RIPR-SPEC-0025](specs/RIPR-SPEC-0025-pr-inline-comment-publisher.md)
publish-plan contract:

- post only from `comments[]`, never from `summary_only[]`;
- target only changed lines;
- cap comments to three by default;
- deduplicate by `dedupe_key`;
- render `repair_card` entries as repair instructions, not raw classification
  labels or confidence scores;
- replace or upsert existing RIPR comments instead of adding duplicates;
- keep comments advisory and non-blocking.

Do not enable inline comments by default in generated workflows.

## Reviewer Loop

Use the PR guidance as the front door, then return to the normal RIPR evidence
loop:

1. Read the `RIPR advisory summary` in the GitHub job summary.
2. Inspect any non-blocking check annotations on changed lines.
3. Open `target/ripr/review/comments.md` when the guidance is summary-only.
4. Use the embedded `ripr agent brief` command for the selected seam.
5. Write one focused test outside RIPR.
6. Capture the after snapshot.
7. Run `ripr agent verify`.
8. Attach the receipt or `ripr agent review-summary` output when useful.

## Pinned Cases

The fixture matrix under
[`fixtures/boundary_gap/expected/pr-guidance`](../fixtures/boundary_gap/expected/pr-guidance/README.md)
pins the current behavior for:

- exact changed seam line;
- changed owner-function line;
- same-file changed line;
- summary-only fallback;
- cap suppression;
- configured-off suppression;
- nearby changed-test skip.

These fixtures are the regression contract for keeping PR guidance bounded and
placement-safe.

## Limits

PR review guidance remains static evidence:

- It does not establish runtime test strength.
- It does not run mutation testing.
- It does not decide whether a PR is mergeable.
- It does not inspect arbitrary diff regions like a general LLM reviewer.
- It does not create source edits or generated tests.

Real mutation testing, when supplied separately, belongs in calibration reports,
not in PR guidance claims.

Use [Recommendation calibration](RECOMMENDATION_CALIBRATION.md) when you need to
measure whether PR guidance was useful, correctly placed, properly suppressed,
and associated with better static evidence after one focused test.

Use [Calibrated gate policy](CALIBRATED_GATE_POLICY.md) only after the advisory
guidance and calibration loop are understood. Gates consume the same evidence;
they do not replace PR guidance or make it blocking by default.
