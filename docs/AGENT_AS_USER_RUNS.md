# Agent-as-user runs

A coding agent is given an installed `ripr`, a small real repository whose
latest commit adds a feature with a weak test, and nothing else: no ripr
docs, no ripr source, no hint about the gap. It is told to fix what ripr
flags. An evaluator then checks, with real mutants, whether the tests the
agent wrote actually catch wrong versions of the feature.

This is an informal, repeatable usability probe. It is **not** the blind
installed-agent acceptance owned by #4600: it runs a workspace build rather
than a frozen successor candidate, keeps no `BlindJourneyReceiptV1`, and its
targets are seeded by the evaluator. Use it to find product friction early;
route each finding to its owning issue.

## Setup

### Targets

Each target is an upstream crate at a pinned commit plus one seeded "gap"
commit that adds a feature and a smoke-only test. The commit message of the
gap commit is the only thing the agent is told about the change.

| Target | Upstream commit | Gap commit message |
|---|---|---|
| `hyunsik/bytesize` | `66a3715e33369e99cb428bcd5aee32291f8e0a94` | `feat: add ByteSize::as_whole_units` |
| `chronotope/humantime` | `76c8929b4cc286f675322475a8e1841f35bafc57` | `feat: accept fortnight as a duration unit` |
| `dtolnay/semver` | `280ebcb6edac3aa4cdc545dbff8a26c5ac4861fe` | `feat: add Version::next_minor` |

Gap patches (apply with `git apply`, then commit on a branch named `gap`):

### Answer key

Three hand-written mutants per target. Each is one textual replacement in the
feature; a tree "catches" a mutant when `cargo test` fails with it applied.
Before the run all nine are missed by the gap commit's own test. Score with
a positive control first: a tree carrying one known-good test (for semver,
`assert_eq!(version("1.2.3-a+b").next_minor(), version("1.3.0"))`) must catch
its target's mutants, or the scorer is broken.

| Target | Mutant | Replacement |
|---|---|---|
| bytesize | zero-guard | `unit == 0 \|\| self.0 % unit != 0` → `self.0 % unit != 0` |
| bytesize | exact-guard | `unit == 0 \|\| self.0 % unit != 0` → `unit == 0` |
| bytesize | quotient | `Some(self.0 / unit)` → `Some(self.0)` |
| humantime | int-factor | whole-number arm `86400 * 14` → `86400 * 7` |
| humantime | frac-factor | fractional arm `86400 * 14` → `86400 * 7` |
| humantime | singular | `"fortnights" \| "fortnight"` → `"fortnights"` |
| semver | patch-reset | `patch: 0` → `patch: self.patch` |
| semver | pre-clear | `pre: Prerelease::EMPTY` → `pre: self.pre.clone()` |
| semver | build-clear | `build: BuildMetadata::EMPTY` → `build: self.build.clone()` |

`cargo mutants --in-diff` over the feature hunks is a second, generated
oracle. It produces few mutants for struct literals (three for semver, two of
them caught by the gap test), so the hand-written key carries the semver
result.

### Instrument

Put a logging shim first on the agent's `PATH` so the evaluator keeps every
invocation independently of the agent's self-report. The shim must keep
stdout and stderr on separate streams: an earlier version merged them, which
put a stderr notice into a redirected `--format repo-exposure-json` file and
made `ripr outcome` fail to parse it. That failure was the shim's, not ripr's.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
log="${AAU_LOG:?}"
o=$(mktemp); e=$(mktemp)
/path/to/real/ripr "$@" >"$o" 2>"$e"; rc=$?
{ printf '\n### cwd=%s rc=%s\n$ ripr' "$PWD" "$rc"; printf ' %q' "$@"
  printf '\n--- stdout\n'; cat "$o"; printf '\n--- stderr\n'; cat "$e"; } >>"$log"
cat "$o"; cat "$e" >&2; rm -f "$o" "$e"; exit $rc
```

Keep the answer key, mutant output and logs outside any directory the agent
may read.

### Agent brief

One fresh agent per target, same text, only the paths substituted:

```text
You are a Rust developer using a tool called `ripr` for the first time. You
have never seen its documentation or source.

Repository: {REPO_DIR}
The most recent commit on the current branch added a small feature. Your job:
use `ripr` to find places where the existing tests may not catch the changed
behavior, and fix what ripr flags by adding or strengthening tests. Use your
own judgment about when you are done.

Rules:
- Start every shell command with `source {ENV_FILE} && ` (it puts ripr on PATH
  and cd's into the repo).
- Learn ripr only from `ripr --help`, `ripr help <command>`, and what ripr
  itself prints. Do not look for ripr's source code, docs, or anything on the
  internet about ripr.
- Do not read or write anything outside {REPO_DIR}.
- Only change test code. Do not change the feature's production code, even if
  you think it has a bug (report it instead).
- You may run `cargo test` and other ordinary cargo commands. Do not install
  tools.

When finished, hand back: every ripr command you ran and whether it answered
what you wanted; the gaps ripr named; what you changed and which finding each
change addresses; every point of friction, quoting the exact output; the
final ripr state and `cargo test` result; anything that looked like a bug in
the feature.
```

## Run 2026-10-04

ripr `0.11.0 (a7a089e1c51dfa51a1727eeefe7e561aaecd7abc)`, release build,
Linux. Three agents, one per target, run in parallel. No agent was given any
help beyond the brief.

### Outcome

| Target | ripr commands | Answer key before → after | `cargo mutants --in-diff` after | ripr after (`--worktree`) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| bytesize | 17 | 0/3 → 3/3 | 10/10 caught | 1 exposed, 2 weakly_exposed |
| humantime | 21 | 0/3 → 3/3 | 6/6 caught (1 unviable) | 2 exposed, 2 weakly_exposed, 1 static_unknown |
| semver | 20 | 0/3 → 3/3 | 2/2 caught (1 unviable) | 5 exposed, 1 reachable_unrevealed |

ripr steered every agent to the real gap: each finished with tests that catch
every answer-key mutant, and no agent edited production code. ripr never
reported `exposed` for a probe whose mutants survived. All three agents ended
with findings they judged, correctly, to be ripr limitations rather than
missing tests.

### Findings

1. **The re-check after adding a test reads HEAD.** All three agents re-ran
   `ripr check` after editing tests, saw identical output, and lost a cycle
   before finding `--worktree`. The note at the end of the output
   (`uncommitted source and test changes were not analyzed`) was read by one
   agent and missed by two. The header names `mode` and `root` but not the
   base or the head it analyzed. `ripr --help` describes the loop as "you add
   one focused test -> ripr records whether the gap closed", which the
   default does not do for an uncommitted test.
2. **Tests that discriminate stay `weakly_exposed` when they don't quote the
   changed text.** Measured:
   - humantime: exact-value tests through `parse_duration` catch all answer-key
     mutants and all `cargo mutants` mutants, yet both `parse_unit` arms stay
     `weakly_exposed` (`reach weak: No test is seen calling parse_unit`).
     The agent flipped them to `exposed` only by writing a white-box test that
     constructs the private `Parser` and calls `parse_unit`. Removing that one
     test returns both arms to `weakly_exposed` while every mutant is still
     caught. ripr rewarded an implementation-coupled test over the end-to-end
     tests that already did the job.
   - bytesize: `return None` and `Some(self.0 / unit)` stay `weakly_exposed`
     (`observation_unverified: no assertion text references this probe's
     changed expression`) under exact `assert_eq!(…, None)` and
     `assert_eq!(…, Some(bytes / unit))` checks that kill every mutant.
   - semver: the `return_value` probe stays `reachable_unrevealed` with
     `rust_assertion_context_unestablished` even for a new test file holding
     only `assert_eq!(Version::new(1, 2, 3).next_minor(), Version::new(1, 3, 0));`.
     In the same run, the field probes rate the same test file's
     `assert_eq!(next.minor, 3)` as a strong exact-value oracle.
3. **Fix sites and related tests come from name or file proximity.**
   `ripr context` proposed `test_format_micros` (humantime), `test_default`
   (bytesize) and `tests/test_identifier.rs` `test_prerelease`
   (`weak_token_substring`, semver) as the place to fix. The human top gap for
   humantime listed `all_86400_seconds` (`same_test_file`) as "Related test
   (1 of 129)" ahead of the test that calls the feature.
4. **A `ripr check` finding cannot start the advertised repair loop.**
   `ripr --help` lists `ripr agent repair --seam-id ID` under "Repair one named
   gap", but `check` prints only `probe:` IDs, and `ripr pilot` ranks seams
   repo-wide: in two of three runs it recommended seams unrelated to the diff
   and said none could start a repair. One agent used pilot's "after" command
   and `ripr outcome` successfully; pilot's named missing value (`0`, equality
   boundary) was the most actionable advice any agent received.
5. **`ripr explain <id>` repeats the `--format human-full` block** for that
   finding and adds only a `Next:` line. Two agents ran it expecting more.
6. **Smaller output defects.**
   - `--format human-full` cut a short source line mid-token
     (`BuildMetadata::EM` / `PTY,`) when a multi-line changed fragment
     passed the 180-column budget in total. Fixed with this document.
   - For the bytesize predicate, `context` reports the stage
     `"discriminate": "yes"` (infection is the weak stage) while `explain`
     prints the verdict line `discriminator not established`. Both may be
     right, but the agent read them as a contradiction.
   - Constants are labelled `source enum variant value crate::KIB`.
   - Pilot's suggested assertion calls a method as a free function:
     `assert_eq!(as_whole_units(/* boundary input where unit == 0 */), …)`.
