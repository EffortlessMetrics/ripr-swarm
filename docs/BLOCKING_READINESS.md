# RIPR Blocking Readiness

Use this guide when deciding whether an optional RIPR gate should stay
advisory, require a visible acknowledgement, or block CI.

RIPR starts as review evidence. Blocking is an adoption choice over measured
local behavior, not a default. Generated workflows keep `RIPR_GATE_MODE` unset
unless a repository explicitly configures a mode.

Read the policy-readiness report before promoting a mode:

```bash
ripr policy readiness \
  --gate-decision target/ripr/reports/gate-decision.json \
  --baseline-delta target/ripr/reports/baseline-debt-delta.json \
  --recommendation-calibration target/ripr/reports/recommendation-calibration.json \
  --mutation-calibration target/ripr/reports/mutation-calibration.json \
  --waiver-aging target/ripr/reports/waiver-aging.json \
  --suppression-health target/ripr/reports/suppression-health.json \
  --out target/ripr/reports/policy-readiness.json \
  --out-md target/ripr/reports/policy-readiness.md
```

The report is advisory. It can recommend a policy mode, but `ripr gate
evaluate` remains the only pass/fail authority when a repository explicitly
configures a gate.

## Decision Ladder

| Stage | Mode | Use when | What can fail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Observe | unset | The repository is collecting PR guidance, SARIF, badges, and artifacts for the first time. | Nothing from RIPR. |
| Explain | `visible-only` | Policy readiness is at least `ready_for_visible_only`, or the repository is intentionally collecting visible evidence before readiness inputs are wired. | Nothing from RIPR. |
| Acknowledge | `acknowledgeable` | Policy readiness is `ready_for_acknowledgeable` or better and the team wants policy-eligible gaps to require either a focused test or a visible `ripr-waive` label. | Unacknowledged policy-eligible stable Rust gaps. |
| Compare | `baseline-check` | Policy readiness is `ready_for_baseline_check` or better, the baseline is reviewed, and old debt should stay visible without blocking. | New policy-eligible stable Rust gaps not in the baseline. |
| Enforce | `calibrated-gate` | Policy readiness is `ready_for_calibrated_gate` and local calibration supports the same narrow stable Rust candidate class. | New calibrated policy-eligible stable Rust gaps. |

Move one stage at a time. Do not jump from advisory evidence to calibrated
blocking just because the evaluator exists.

## Readiness Ceiling

Treat the policy-readiness status as the ceiling for stricter gate posture:

| Policy readiness status | Maximum safe posture | Operator response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config_error` | unset | Fix unreadable or contradictory policy inputs before interpreting the report. |
| `not_ready` | unset or `visible-only` | Keep evidence visible and repair the unhealthy axis first. |
| `advisory_only` | unset or `visible-only` | Collect reports and reviewer experience without requiring acknowledgement. |
| `ready_for_visible_only` | `visible-only` | Surface decisions and counts, but do not require labels or baseline membership. |
| `ready_for_acknowledgeable` | `acknowledgeable` | Require focused repair or visible PR acknowledgement for eligible stable Rust gaps. |
| `ready_for_baseline_check` | `baseline-check` | Block only new eligible stable Rust debt outside the reviewed baseline. |
| `ready_for_calibrated_gate` | `calibrated-gate` | Block only the narrow eligible class covered by same-class recommendation calibration. |

This is a ceiling, not an automatic rollout. A maintainer can always stay more
advisory than the report recommends.

Use the readiness axes this way:

| Axis | Promotion signal | Stay advisory when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `baseline_health` | Baseline exists, parses, joins current evidence, and uses shrink-only refresh. | Baseline is missing, stale, malformed, or would need new debt adoption to pass. |
| `waiver_health` | Waivers are visible PR-time acknowledgements with manageable aging. | Repeated waivers are high enough that a focused test, baseline, or suppression review should happen first. |
| `suppression_health` | Suppressions have owner, reason, scope, review date, visibility, static class, and language status. | Suppressions are missing owner/reason, stale, overbroad, unknown, or preview without preview label. |
| `calibration_health` | Recommendation calibration covers the same candidate class; mutation calibration, if present, joins unambiguously. | Calibration is missing, noisy, ambiguous, or for a different class. |
| `preview_evidence_boundary` | Preview evidence is labeled, visible, and counted as advisory only. | Preview-language findings dominate the decision or lack preview/static-limit labels. |

## Stay Advisory

Keep `RIPR_GATE_MODE` unset or use `visible-only` when any of these are true:

- reviewers have not inspected several `gate-decision.md` reports;
- PR guidance frequently points at the wrong line or needs summary-only
  fallback;
- recommendation calibration is missing, mostly `unknown`, or noisy for the
  candidate class you would block on;
- the repository has not reviewed a baseline for existing findings;
- the team has not agreed how to use `ripr-waive`;
- waiver aging is high enough that repeated acknowledgement needs review;
- durable suppressions are missing owner, reason, scope, or review state;
- preview-language findings dominate the report or lack preview labels;
- imported mutation calibration is unavailable, ambiguous, or not joined to
  the same candidate class;
- failures would not include a focused test shape and verify command;
- the workflow is still being rolled out to a new repository.

Advisory mode is still useful. It should show the top recommendation, gate
counts, labels, baseline state, calibration availability, and artifact paths in
the job summary.

## Require Acknowledgement

Use `acknowledgeable` when the team is ready to make policy-eligible findings
visible in review without turning every finding into a hard stop.

Before enabling it:

- confirm policy readiness is at least `ready_for_acknowledgeable`;
- create the `ripr-waive` label;
- make sure `target/ci/labels.json` is captured in CI;
- confirm the job summary shows acknowledged findings, not silent success;
- document when a reviewer should add the label instead of adding a focused
  test;
- keep waivers PR-local and separate from `.ripr/suppressions.toml`.

An acknowledged decision is still evidence. The finding should remain in
`gate-decision.json`, `gate-decision.md`, and the job summary with the label
that changed the decision.

Preview-language findings can be acknowledged as advisory review context, but
acknowledgement does not promote them into gate eligibility.

## Use Baseline Check

Use `baseline-check` after the repository has reviewed current gate output and
created a small checked-in baseline for historical debt.

Use [Baseline ledger workflow](BASELINE_LEDGER_WORKFLOW.md) for the concrete
`ripr baseline create`, `ripr baseline diff`, and shrink-only
`ripr baseline update --remove-resolved` commands.

Before enabling it:

- confirm policy readiness is at least `ready_for_baseline_check`;
- generate a candidate baseline from reviewed `gate-decision.json` output;
- remove malformed, suppressed, configured-off, or soon-to-fix entries;
- commit the baseline path configured by `RIPR_GATE_BASELINE`;
- run `visible-only` or `baseline-check` on the baseline PR;
- confirm baseline hits remain visible and non-blocking;
- confirm a new unbaselined candidate blocks in a controlled trial run.

Refresh the baseline by shrinking it when focused tests remove old findings.
Do not add new PR-time findings to the baseline just to make a run pass.

Preview-language evidence may appear in an advisory baseline partition, but it
must not participate in default `baseline-check` blocking unless a later
explicit policy promotes that exact class.

## Enable Calibrated Blocking

Use `calibrated-gate` only when all of these are true:

- policy readiness is `ready_for_calibrated_gate`;
- `baseline-check` already behaves predictably;
- recommendation calibration is available for the relevant candidate class;
- calibration outcomes are usually `useful`, correctly placed, and not noisy;
- missing calibration stays visible as unknown confidence instead of becoming
  a block;
- any imported mutation calibration joins unambiguously to the same seam;
- blocked summaries explain the missing discriminator, suggested focused test,
  acknowledgement path, baseline state, and verification command;
- artifact uploads still happen before the job fails.

This mode should remain narrow. It should block only new, calibrated,
policy-eligible gaps under the configured scope.

Preview TypeScript and Python evidence is not mutation-calibrated confidence
by default. A future promotion must name the language, candidate class,
static-limit exclusions, calibration threshold, baseline behavior, suppression
behavior, generated CI posture, and rollback path before preview evidence can
be used for calibrated blocking.

## Preview Evidence Boundary

Preview-language evidence follows a separate policy boundary:

| Question | Default answer |
| --- | --- |
| Can it be shown? | Yes, with `language_status = "preview"` and static-limit labels. |
| Can it be acknowledged or waived? | Yes, as visible advisory review state. |
| Can it be suppressed? | Yes, with owner, reason, scope, review date, expected visibility, static class, and preview label. |
| Can it be baselined? | Advisory partition only. |
| Can it be used for a gate? | No, unless later explicit policy promotes the exact class. |
| Can it count against RIPR 0? | No, unless later explicit policy promotes the exact class. |
| Can it provide calibrated confidence? | No, unless later explicit policy promotes the exact class. |

Generated CI should keep preview evidence visible in artifacts and summaries,
but preview evidence must not become a required check, comment-posting trigger,
RIPR 0 blocker, or default gate input by accident.

## Repair Expectations

A blocking RIPR summary should let a reviewer or follow-up agent act without
opening raw JSON first. It should include:

- policy mode and status;
- changed seam and static class;
- missing discriminator;
- suggested focused test shape;
- best related test when available;
- baseline and acknowledgement state;
- recommendation and mutation calibration availability;
- preview-language boundary state when preview findings are present;
- verify command or artifact path;
- `ripr-waive` path when acknowledgement is acceptable.

If those fields are missing or confusing, treat the mode as not ready to block.

## Gate Adoption Checklist

Complete this checklist before moving beyond advisory evidence or
`visible-only`. It is an adoption checklist for the repair loop, not a reason
to make generated CI block by default.

- `policy-readiness.md` recommends the target mode, or a stricter ceiling, and
  no readiness axis is still reporting the failure mode that the target mode
  would depend on.
- Reviewers have inspected several `gate-decision.md` and generated-CI
  summaries for recent PRs, including at least one empty or no-action PR when
  the repository has that case.
- The top repairable RIPR gap was useful on the agreed sample of recent PRs.
  Record the sample size before the trial so the decision is not based on one
  memorable success.
- Blocking summaries name the gap, missing discriminator, focused test or
  output-proof shape, acknowledgement path, baseline state, and verification
  command without opening raw JSON first.
- The checked-in baseline, if used, has been reviewed as historical debt and
  can be refreshed by shrink-only removal after focused repairs.
- `.ripr/suppressions.toml` has been reviewed for owner, reason, scope,
  visibility, static class, language status, and review date.
- The `ripr-waive` policy is written down: who can apply it, when it is
  appropriate, and when a focused test or output fixture is expected instead.
- Empty diffs and no-action PRs produce schema-valid advisory packets, not
  blocked runs or missing-artifact failures.
- Known timeout paths produce advisory error packets with retry commands and do
  not leave reviewers without uploaded artifacts.
- Preview TypeScript and Python findings remain visibly preview/advisory and
  are not gate-eligible unless a later policy promotes the exact class.
- The team understands that RIPR gates are static repair-routing policy. They
  do not claim runtime mutation adequacy, coverage adequacy, or general
  correctness.
- Generated CI still leaves `RIPR_GATE_MODE` unset by default, and rollout is a
  repository-variable change rather than a forked workflow.
- Rollback has been rehearsed by unsetting `RIPR_GATE_MODE` and, when present,
  `RIPR_GATE_BASELINE` while keeping advisory summaries and artifact uploads.

Use these supporting documents while checking the list:

- [Policy readiness](policy/POLICY_READINESS.md) for the readiness axes and
  preview-evidence boundary.
- [Calibrated gate policy](CALIBRATED_GATE_POLICY.md) for mode behavior,
  waiver semantics, and generated-CI inputs.
- [Baseline ledger workflow](BASELINE_LEDGER_WORKFLOW.md) for reviewed
  baseline creation and shrink-only refresh.
- [CI gate adoption examples](CI.md#gate-adoption-examples) for repository
  variable examples.
- [PR automation](PR_AUTOMATION.md) for local receipts and generated report
  packets used as adoption evidence.

## Rollback

Rollback is configuration-only:

```text
RIPR_GATE_MODE=
RIPR_GATE_BASELINE=
```

Unset the mode to return to advisory PR guidance, SARIF, badges, agent
artifacts, and report uploads. Keep the receipts; they explain why blocking was
paused and what evidence should improve before trying again.

## Repo Dogfood

This repository records gate-adoption receipts with:

```bash
cargo xtask dogfood
```

The report shows visible-only, acknowledged, baseline-aware, and
calibrated-gate decisions from checked RIPR evidence while preserving
`default_generated_ci_blocking = false`. Use it as a local adoption receipt,
not as a reason for default generated workflows to block.
