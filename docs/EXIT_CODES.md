# Exit Codes

ripr uses a three-value exit code contract:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0`  | The command completed. |
| `2`  | The command could not complete: usage, parse, operational, or internal error. |
| `3`  | The command ran successfully and reached a blocking decision or a typed refusal. |

`ripr check` is advisory: it exits `0` whether or not it found gaps, including
`exposed` and `weakly_exposed` findings. A non-zero exit from `check` means the
analysis did not complete, not that it disapproved of your diff. The blocking
decision belongs to `ripr gate evaluate`, which exits `3` when the gate blocks
after writing its report. Do not build a CI gate on `check`'s exit code; read
its output, or run the gate.

## Why codes 2 and 3?

ripr uses exit code `2` for all could-not-complete conditions (not `1`) to
distinguish it from shell-level errors (which typically use `1`). Code `3` is
reserved for outcomes where the command itself ran to a deliberate, typed
answer — a blocking gate decision, or a typed refusal such as `ripr agent
verify-execute` declining a packet (the refusal JSON document is on stdout)
— so an orchestrator can branch on the exit status alone:

- `0`: the command completed (for `verify-execute`, the verification ran;
  read the disposition in the stdout JSON).
- `3`: the command completed by reaching a blocking decision or typed
  refusal; read the report or the stdout JSON document for the answer
  (standalone `ripr agent verify` is the exception: its refusal is named on
  stderr and stdout stays empty; see below. `ripr agent repair` prints its
  refusal document only with `--json`; without it stdout stays empty and
  stderr names the cause. `ripr agent card` prints its
  `agent_card_refusal` envelope on stderr with `--json` and the prose
  rendering after it; stdout stays empty on every refusal).
- `2`: the invocation or operation failed; retrying differently is
  appropriate.

`ripr help --json` projects this same mapping as a typed per-command `exit`
object (RIPR-SPEC-0190). Orchestrators that discover commands from that
document should branch on `exit`, not on free-text `stop_states`.

## When you see exit code 2

- **Analysis error**: the diff could not be read (a missing or unreadable
  `--diff` path, or a directory), the diff exceeded the hard
  `RIPR_MAX_DIFF_*` guards (`diff_scope_oversized` with no analysis run), the
  base ref could not be resolved, or the workspace root could not be
  determined. A diff that is read but does not parse (no file headers or
  hunks) is not an exit-2 error: `ripr check` exits `0` with the typed
  outcome `unsupported_input` (the human header reads
  `Analysis outcome: the input is not supported (analysis incomplete; unsupported_input).`). A run that analyzed only
  part of its scope also exits `0`, with `partial_with_limitations`: a diff
  over the smaller partial budget (its limitation is also named
  `diff_scope_oversized`), a changed Rust file the parser refused and read
  lexically, or a changed file whose language adapter is unavailable. The
  parser follows stable Rust, so a changed file using nightly-only syntax it
  cannot parse (guard patterns, never patterns) also makes the run partial.
  With `--json`, every post-argv-parse `check` failure — the analysis errors
  above, an unreadable config or suppression policy, a git timeout, or any
  other failure the command can produce — also writes a machine-readable
  refusal document to stdout naming the failure; the exit stays `2` and the
  human prose stays on stderr. Only argv usage errors stay prose-only with
  empty stdout. [docs/OUTPUT_SCHEMA.md](OUTPUT_SCHEMA.md) documents the
  refusal shape and its `schema_version`.
- **User error**: unknown command, missing required argument, or invalid
  config.
- **Internal error**: a panic occurred (with a `ripr: internal error` message).
- **Closed output pipe**: the reader of stdout went away early (for example
  `ripr doctor | head`). ripr stops quietly with `2`, not `0`, because its
  output was cut short; it never turns a would-be `3` into a pass. Output
  small enough to be written in full before the reader closes never meets
  the closed pipe, so that run keeps its own exit code.

## When you see exit code 3

- **Gate failure**: `ripr gate evaluate` evaluated successfully and blocked
  the PR; the full report was still written to `--out`.
- **Typed refusal**: `ripr agent verify-execute` refused the packet (for
  example `verification_rejected_policy` or `verification_wrong_root`) and
  rendered the typed refusal JSON on stdout; `ripr agent repair --phase
  after` refused with a named cause after selecting its attempt — a diverged
  HEAD, drifted analysis inputs, a no-movement verify refusal, a replaced
  trust-binding manifest, or a receipt refused on trusted-surface grounds
  (tracked content differs from the attempt's before-phase head outside the
  allowed test surface; the recovery narration names the commit-first route,
  #5262) — with the cause named on stderr, the refusal recorded on the
  attempt (the trusted-surface refusal is recorded beside the finished
  attempt's after verdict), and, with `--json`, one JSON document on stdout
  (the `repair_after_refusal` document naming the cause and recovery when the
  refusal came before the verify render, otherwise the bare agent verify
  document — the trusted-surface refusal always fires after the verify
  render). Without `--json` stdout stays empty on a refusal and stderr
  carries the cause and recovery. Operational errors after attempt selection (an unreadable
  retained packet or manifest, a failed artifact write) still exit `2`.
- **Typed verify refusal**: standalone `ripr agent verify` refused the pair
  for drifted analysis inputs (`analysis input identities differ`) or no
  repository movement between the artifacts — the same named refusals the
  repair after phase maps to `3`. This is the one exit-`3` path whose stdout
  stays empty: `agent verify`'s stdout is the verify artifact (the packet's
  `next` loop redirects it into `agent-verify.json`), and a rejected verify
  renders nothing to it (RIPR-SPEC-0134). The named cause is on stderr.
  Other verify rejections (unreadable or invalid artifacts, lineage or
  metadata mismatches) exit `2`.
- **Agent stub refusal**: `ripr agent stub` found the gap but will not write
  a stub for it (a side-effect or call-presence change, a changed field of a
  struct the owner does not return directly, an async, unsafe, or generic
  owner, an impl with type or const generics, an impl local to a function
  body or `const` block, an owner behind a cfg in its own file that a plain
  `cargo test` build may not enable, no return value, an out-of-line test module, or
  inline test modules that are all gated by more than `cfg(test)`), or the
  selector names no reported gap. Several inline test modules are not a
  refusal: among those gated by plain `cfg(test)`, the stub goes into the
  one that already names the owner, else the nearest one after it, else the
  nearest one before it. The named reason is on stderr, with
  a `rust_test_stub` `state: refused` envelope under `--json`; stdout stays
  empty. A failed read, analysis, or `--write` stays exit `2`.
- **Typed agent card refusal**: `ripr agent card` reached a deliberate named
  refusal of the default handoff — the seam id names no seam
  (`seam_not_found`: re-list seams or correct the id), the seam's grip class
  is policy-omitted (`policy_omitted`: check the `agent brief` policy config;
  re-listing cannot fix it), the witness analysis produced no witness
  (`witness_unavailable`: rerun the analysis or pick another seam), no
  admitted evidence names a portable workspace identity
  (`identity_unnameable`: retrieve the full packet instead), or the card
  builder, route gate, or budget refused to mint the card
  (`budget_overflow`: fall back to the canonical packet). With `--json` the
  versioned `agent_card_refusal` envelope (`schema_version` `0.1`) renders
  on stderr with the typed `error.kind`, `seam_id`, verbatim `message`, and
  `remedy_route`; stdout stays empty because it is the card-artifact stream.
  Without `--json` stderr carries the prose rendering only. The kinds are
  closed and pinned by `cargo xtask check-output-contracts`
  (RIPR-SPEC-0202). Operational failures of the command (an unreadable
  config, a failed git probe, a detail-source serialization failure) still
  exit `2`.

These are findings- and policy-driven exits, not operational failures; a
monitoring system should page on `2`, not on `3`.

Some refusals still exit `2` because the command could not do what was asked:
`ripr receipt check` when the receipt is orphaned or its gap does not match
the ledger (the verdict is in the `--json` document), when a named `--ledger`
cannot be read, or when `--gap` names a different gap than the receipt;
`ripr agent receipt` when the attempt is not receipt-ready; `ripr agent
repair --phase verify` without its explicit authorization or on a moved
tree; and a repair `--phase after` whose edit cage recorded a violation.

## `ripr doctor` exit codes

`ripr doctor` uses the same contract: `0` when all checks pass, `2` when
any check fails (including missing language runtimes that are enabled in
the effective configuration).

The `Cargo.toml`, `cargo`, and `rustc` checks apply only when Rust is in
scope for the root: Rust is enabled and either Rust markers (`Cargo.toml` or
`.rs` files) are detected or no other language is detected or enabled. A
Python-only or TypeScript-only root reports those checks as `skipped` with
the reason and does not fail on them. A Rust root, a root with Rust sources but no
`Cargo.toml`, and an empty root under the Rust-only default still fail on a
missing manifest.

The toolchain checks depend on the profile. Under the default `analysis`
profile, a missing `cargo` or `rustc`, or a workspace `rustc` older than
RIPR's build MSRV, is reported as `advisory` and does not change the exit
code: the installed binary can still analyze the workspace. A missing `cargo`
still withholds evidence that reads `cargo metadata`. Under
`--profile source-build`, the same conditions are failures and exit `2`, while
enabled language runtimes stay visible but do not decide that profile's exit.

## CI integration

The GitHub Actions workflow that `ripr init --ci github` generates runs its
whole analysis in one step, and the step does not swallow its exit code:

```yaml
      - name: Run RIPR
        run: ripr reports ci-packet --root .
```

`ripr reports ci-packet` runs the pilot, the pull request diff capture, the
PR guidance, the comment plan, the SARIF and badge renders, the gate, the
ledgers, start-here, the report index, and the changed-line annotations,
each as a log group named after the step it replaced ([docs/CI.md](CI.md)
keeps the full recipe). Advisory steps log a failure and continue. The diff
capture and the gate evaluation are required, so a failed diff capture,
gate evaluation, or blocking-mode producer makes the command exit nonzero
after the rest of the packet is written: the step fails instead of passing
on an incomplete analysis, and the later `always()` steps still upload the
artifacts and the step summary.

The exit code reaches the merge gate through `RIPR_GATE_MODE`, not through
a check step. The generated job carries
`continue-on-error: ${{ vars.RIPR_GATE_MODE == '' || vars.RIPR_GATE_MODE == 'visible-only' }}`:
empty (the default, advisory) or `visible-only` never fails the job;
`acknowledgeable`, `baseline-check`, or `calibrated-gate` fails the job on
a nonzero step exit. `ripr check` is advisory here as everywhere: it exits
`0` whether or not it found gaps. When `RIPR_GATE_MODE` is set, the packet
evaluates the gate, and `ripr gate evaluate` exits `3` when it blocks and
`2` on a `config_error`; it treats an incomplete, partial, or unsupported
analysis outcome as a `config_error` in every mode, so a gate never passes
on a partial denominator.
