# Exit Codes

ripr uses a three-value exit code contract:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0`  | The command completed. |
| `2`  | The command could not complete: usage, parse, operational, or internal error. |
| `3`  | The command ran successfully and reached a blocking decision or a typed refusal. |

`ripr check` is advisory: it exits `0` whether or not it found gaps, including
`exposed` and `weakly_exposed` findings. A non-zero exit from `check` means the
analysis did not complete, not that it disapproved of your diff. The blocking
decision belongs to `ripr gate evaluate`, which exits `3` when the gate blocks
after writing its report. Do not build a CI gate on `check`'s exit code; read
its output, or run the gate.

## Why codes 2 and 3?

ripr uses exit code `2` for all could-not-complete conditions (not `1`) to
distinguish it from shell-level errors (which typically use `1`). Code `3` is
reserved for outcomes where the command itself ran to a deliberate, typed
answer — a blocking gate decision, or a typed refusal such as `ripr agent
verify-execute` declining a packet (the refusal JSON document is on stdout)
— so an orchestrator can branch on the exit status alone:

- `0`: the command completed (for `verify-execute`, the verification ran;
  read the disposition in the stdout JSON).
- `3`: the command completed by reaching a blocking decision or typed
  refusal; read the report or the stdout JSON document for the answer.
- `2`: the invocation or operation failed; retrying differently is
  appropriate.

## When you see exit code 2

- **Analysis error**: the diff could not be parsed, the base ref could not
  be resolved, or the workspace root could not be determined.
- **User error**: unknown command, missing required argument, or invalid
  config.
- **Internal error**: a panic occurred (with a `ripr: internal error` message).

## When you see exit code 3

- **Gate failure**: `ripr gate evaluate` evaluated successfully and blocked
  the PR; the full report was still written to `--out`.
- **Typed refusal**: `ripr agent verify-execute` refused the packet (for
  example `verification_rejected_policy` or `verification_wrong_root`) and
  rendered the typed refusal JSON on stdout; `ripr agent repair --phase
  after` refused after selecting its attempt (the refusal is recorded on the
  attempt).

These are findings- and policy-driven exits, not operational failures; a
monitoring system should page on `2`, not on `3`.

## `ripr doctor` exit codes

`ripr doctor` uses the same contract: `0` when all checks pass, `2` when
any check fails (including missing language runtimes that are enabled in
the effective configuration).

The `Cargo.toml`, `cargo`, and `rustc` checks apply only when Rust is in
scope for the root: Rust is enabled and either Rust markers (`Cargo.toml` or
`.rs` files) are detected or no other language is detected or enabled. A
Python-only or TypeScript-only root reports those checks as `skipped` with
the reason and does not fail on them. A Rust root, a root with Rust sources but no
`Cargo.toml`, and an empty root under the Rust-only default still fail on a
missing manifest or toolchain.

## CI integration

In generated GitHub Actions workflows, ripr preserves the exit code:

```yaml
ripr check --root . --mode draft --format json > check.json || check_status=$?
```

The `|| check_status=$?` pattern captures the exit code without failing the
step, so downstream review-comments and gate steps can consume the
output even when the analysis failed. Because `check` exits `0` on findings,
a non-zero `check_status` here means the analysis itself did not complete
(code `2`; a gate step consumes code `3` as its blocking signal).
