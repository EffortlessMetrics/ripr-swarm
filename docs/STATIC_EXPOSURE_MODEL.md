# Static Exposure Model

`ripr` is **static mutation-exposure analysis**. It catches the same class
of signal mutation testing catches — weak test/oracle exposure on changed
behavior — but earlier and cheaper, by reading the diff at draft time
instead of running mutants. It does not find or run actual mutants;
mutation testing remains the slower runtime backstop for what static
analysis cannot predict.

It creates mutation-shaped probes from changed code and asks whether existing
tests appear to provide the RIPR chain needed to expose the changed behavior:

```text
Reach -> Infect -> Propagate -> Observe -> Discriminate
```

## Probe

A probe is an unexecuted, mutation-shaped hypothesis attached to changed code.

Examples:

| Change shape | Probe family | Expected discriminator |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `>` changed to `>=` | `predicate` | boundary test at equality |
| error variant changed | `error_path` | exact error variant assertion |
| returned field changed | `field_construction` or `return_value` | field, whole-object, or snapshot assertion |
| side effect added | `side_effect` | mock, event, state, persistence, or metric oracle |
| match arm changed | `match_arm` | input selecting arm plus exact assertion |

The current MVP probe families are:

- `predicate`
- `return_value`
- `error_path`
- `call_deletion`
- `field_construction`
- `side_effect`
- `match_arm`
- `static_unknown`

## RIPR Stages

`Reach` asks whether a related test appears to reach the changed owner.

`Infect` asks whether test inputs appear capable of activating the changed
behavior, such as a boundary value for a predicate.

`Propagate` asks whether the changed state appears able to flow to an observable
value, error, field, side effect, event, state change, or persistence boundary.

`Observe` asks whether a related test has an oracle near the propagated effect.

`Discriminate` asks whether that oracle is strong enough to distinguish intended
behavior from a plausible wrong behavior.

## Stage States

Stage states are intentionally conservative:

- `yes`
- `weak`
- `no`
- `unknown`
- `opaque`
- `not_applicable`

`unknown` and `opaque` are not failures of the tool. They are honest signals that
static analysis should stop or escalate.

## Exposure Classes

| Class | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `exposed` | Static evidence suggests a complete RIPR path to a strong oracle that observes the changed sink (see Discrimination vs Coverage). |
| `weakly_exposed` | A path exists, but infection or discrimination appears weak. |
| `reachable_unrevealed` | Related tests appear reachable, but no meaningful oracle was found. |
| `no_static_path` | No static test path was found for the changed owner. |
| `infection_unknown` | Reachability exists, but input or fixture evidence is opaque. |
| `propagation_unknown` | The changed behavior crosses an opaque propagation boundary. |
| `static_unknown` | Syntax-first analysis cannot make a credible judgment. |

## Public Badge Projection

Public `ripr` badges are not raw exposure-class totals, seam-native inventory,
coverage, mutation adequacy, all behavior seams, or all untested code. They
project unresolved actionable static repair gaps: canonical gaps with a repair
route, verification path, receipt path, and public projection eligibility.
`ripr+` adds only actionable test-efficiency repairs lifted into the same
repair / verify / receipt model. Detailed seam-native inventory remains an
internal pressure report for evidence quality and static limitations.

## Analysis Modes

Modes define how much static evidence `ripr` is allowed to gather before it
classifies probes. They change scope and cost; they do not change the meaning of
the exposure classes.

| Mode | Scope in the current alpha | Intended use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `instant` | Changed Rust files only. | Editor-safe, cheapest feedback. |
| `draft` | Rust files in packages touched by the diff. | Default local scan. |
| `fast` | Same package-local scope as `draft` for now. | Draft PR scan; future bounded graph work lands here. |
| `deep` | All Rust files in the workspace. | Manual or CI scan when wider static evidence is acceptable. |
| `ready` | All Rust files in the workspace. | Static preflight before real mutation confirmation. |

`ready` mode still does not run mutants or report mutation outcomes. It remains
static exposure analysis unless a future calibration or mutation adapter is
explicitly invoked.

## Oracle Strength

Strong oracle examples:

- `assert_eq!`
- `assert_ne!`
- `assert_matches!`
- exact enum or error variant assertion
- whole-object equality
- configured snapshot or mock oracle

Weak or smoke oracle examples:

- `assert!(result.is_ok())`
- `assert!(result.is_err())`
- `unwrap()`
- `expect()`
- `assert!(x > 0)`
- `assert!(!items.is_empty())`

The MVP favors high-signal distinctions over completeness. A weak oracle is not
bad by itself; it is weak when the changed behavior needs a stronger
discriminator.

## Discrimination vs Coverage

`ripr` is not a coverage tool, and the difference is the entire point. Coverage
asks whether a line *executed*. `ripr` asks whether a test would *notice* the
changed behavior being wrong — whether some oracle actually observes the value
the change moves.

A test can execute every branch of a function and assert almost nothing
(`assert result is not None`, a smoke check, or a mock that never inspects the
changed value). Execution alone does not establish a discriminator. A strong,
aligned discriminator asks more of the test than line coverage does.

That distinction between evidence types is not a guarantee about analyzer
output. Under the [badge projection](#public-badge-projection), `ripr 0` means
zero unresolved actionable gaps in the eligible projection. Limited, excluded,
unresolved, or non-routable behavior does not become positively credited merely
because it contributes no actionable gap. `ripr+ 0` additionally has no projected
actionable test-efficiency repairs; it does not establish that every changed
behavior has a strong oracle.

Read the signals separately:

```text
coverage         execution evidence for the measured test run
RIPR evidence    static relation, activation, propagation, and oracle evidence
runtime mutation an observed outcome for a concrete executed counterfactual
```

The useful question remains whether a test discriminates the changed behavior.
How reliably RIPR answers it, and how much downstream verification its evidence
can justify displacing, require independent evaluation rather than a zero badge
count. See [Two error rates](#two-error-rates) and the historical panel boundary
below.

### The alignment invariant

The standing danger for a static analyzer is to drift back into coverage by
crediting proximity as discrimination: "a strong oracle reaches the owner,
therefore the behavior is checked." That is false. A strong oracle that observes
a *different* value than the changed sink does not discriminate the change — a
test asserting a wrapped function's return value does not pin a boundary deep
inside the wrapper, even though the assertion is strong and exact.

So `exposed` requires **sink alignment**: the strong oracle must observe the
changed behavior's output — its assertion references the changed owner (by name
or import alias) or the changed sink (the attribute, field, or value the change
touches). A strong-but-orthogonal oracle downgrades to `weakly_exposed` with a
typed reason and routes a repair, rather than being silently called covered.

### Identity beats token overlap

A changed owner or sink may share *words* with unrelated tests; that overlap is
not proof. A test for `PaymentProcessor.validate` does not discriminate
`TokenValidator.validate` just because both contain the token `validate`, and a
`buffered_output` variable does not observe a changed `buffer` just because one
string contains the other. Sink alignment matches *tokens*; tokens are not
*identity*.

So for method, classmethod, attribute, and other receiver-dependent owners, a
bare method-name match is **not** sufficient to credit `exposed`. It requires
owner-class identity: the test imports or constructs the owner's class, calls a
known alias, binds a simple local receiver from the owner, or the oracle observes
the owner's class token or the changed sink directly. Bare method-name or
bare-`.method(` overlap is weaker evidence and must downgrade to `weakly_exposed`,
never silently credit `exposed`. Token matching may *support* a relation; it must
not *be* the identity. (Whole-word matching alone is not enough either — the word
can belong to the wrong owner; see `docs/LEARNINGS.md` § Token coincidence is a
false-`exposed` family.)

### Two error rates

Trust in `ripr` rests on two error rates, not one:

- **false-actionable** — it routed a repair for a behavior that is actually
  discriminated. Visible: inspect the emitted finding.
- **false-`exposed` / over-credit** — it called a behavior covered when no oracle
  discriminates it. *Silent*: `ripr` emits nothing, so it cannot be found by
  inspecting output, only against ground truth on the cases where `ripr` stayed
  quiet.

The second is the more dangerous: it is the failure that makes a discriminator
indistinguishable from coverage, and the one a cheap robustness sweep
structurally cannot see.

### The static/runtime boundary

`exposed` is a **static** claim: *a strong oracle observes the changed sink's
output*. It is **not** the runtime claim *the mutant is killed under this test's
inputs*. Those differ whenever a test observes the changed output but its concrete
input makes the old and new behavior coincide. Adversarial sweeps surface many such
cases; they split into two kinds, and only one is a `ripr` bug.

- **Runtime-equivalence floor (out of contract).** The oracle genuinely observes the
  changed output, but only *evaluation* reveals old ≡ new for the chosen input:
  an operator identity (`total += amount` vs `-=` tested with `amount == 0`), a
  coincident result (`s[::2]` and `s[::3]` both yield `"aa"` for `"aaaa"`), a
  boolean short-circuit, or an ASCII-only `lower()`/`casefold()`. Detecting these
  requires running the (mutated) expression under the test's arguments — i.e.
  mutation testing — which `ripr` does not do. `ripr` cannot distinguish a
  discriminating `compute(10, 3) == 7` from a non-discriminating
  `apply_discount(5, 100) == 5` without evaluation, so it must not over-tighten here:
  a conservative downgrade would also drop the genuine discriminators. This is the
  honest floor of static exposure analysis, not a defect.

- **Static missing-discriminator (in contract).** A predicate/boundary change has a
  discriminator `ripr` *can name syntactically*: `if total >= threshold` → `>` is
  discriminated only by an input where `total == threshold`. A test that exercises a
  value far from the boundary does not discriminate the change — and `ripr` should
  not call it `exposed` — but the gap is nameable (`missing discriminator: total ==
  threshold`) and therefore a valid static **repair-routing candidate**, not floor.

The line to hold: *input-specific old/new equivalence is a runtime floor; a
syntactically nameable missing discriminator stays in scope as a gap.* `exposed`
should never silently mean "the mutant survives for this input."

## Repository-local Rust includes

Rust analysis treats a parser-recognized, file-level repository-local literal
`include!("path.rs")` as part of its parent file's compilation unit. Functions
from the included fragment therefore use the parent's semantic owner identity,
while findings retain the fragment's real path and line for review. This keeps
private parent state and nearby parent tests visible without rewriting the
source into synthetic modules.

Resolution is deliberately bounded and fail-closed. Nested module contexts,
dynamic expressions, missing or ambiguous targets, repository or symlink
escapes, cycles, excessive depth, more than 512 include edges, and included
files over 4 MiB remain unsupported. Human-facing analysis routes disclose
these boundaries with stable `rust_include_*` reason codes; parser fallback
retains the analyzer's existing lexical-fallback disclosure. Included files
must also be present in the selected analysis scope, so `instant` mode can
disclose an unindexed target while `ready` mode supplies workspace-wide
evidence.

This support does not expand macros or claim compiler-equivalent name
resolution. It preserves the analyzer's syntax-first boundary while avoiding
the previous false standalone-module identity for the bounded literal form.

## Finding Shape

A useful finding should include:

- changed behavior
- probe family
- RIPR stage evidence
- related tests
- observed oracle strength
- missing discriminator
- recommended next step

The recommended next step should be specific enough for a human or coding agent
to write the targeted test.

## Escalation

Escalate to real mutation testing when:

- propagation stops at an opaque fixture or macro
- dynamic dispatch hides the call path
- async causality is unclear
- external state is involved
- static evidence and human intuition disagree
- the finding would block a release decision

## The discriminator test, turned inward

`ripr` exists to catch one failure shape: a test that *reaches* the changed
behavior but does not *discriminate* it — a green signal that says nothing about
whether the behavior is actually checked. Building `ripr` against real external
code surfaced that same shape at every other layer of the system, which is the
sharpest thing the project has learned about itself:

- A CI gate that *runs* but is not *required* reaches the regression without
  blocking the merge — a green-looking gate that discriminates nothing.
- A consumer that reads the wrong output key (a parser keyed on `class` when the
  artifact emits `classification`) stays green against its own fixture while
  blind to the live output.
- A sweep that analyzed zero repositories reports a vacuous pass — a success
  state with no denominator.
- A validated implementation plan can *assume* a strong oracle that running the
  binary shows does not exist — a plan that reaches the right files and
  discriminates nothing.
- And `ripr` itself under-credits a discriminating test when the oracle reaches
  the owner only through an indirect call (a local binding, an inline
  construct-call, framework dispatch) that syntax-first analysis cannot trace.

These are one failure: **a pass without both a denominator and a discriminator.**
The discipline that counters it is identical everywhere — verify the *artifact*,
not the proxy for it. Run the binary; do not trust the code-reading. Read the
required check's result; do not trust the merge button. Diff the golden; do not
trust "it passed." The report, the plan, the gate, and the green check are all
proxies; the artifact is ground truth.

### Two error rates, measured on real code

The retained June 13–14, 2026 Python artifacts contain **seven historical manual
judgments**: three in the
[starter panel](../fixtures/python-judged-pr-panel/starter-judged.json) and four
in the [scaled panel](../fixtures/python-judged-pr-panel/scaled-judged.json).
The separate Tier A manifest selected eight repositories; its timeout row does
not create an eighth structural judgment.

The stored post-repair labels record zero false-`exposed` cases and three
false-actionable cases across those seven judgments. These are observations of
the selected historical cases, not current or representative error rates. The
remaining over-suggestions include indirect-call and framework-observation
relations the analyzer did not resolve.

The distinction between denominators matters. In those retained post-repair
rows, only one actual classification is `exposed`. Seven total judgments is
therefore not the denominator for estimating error **conditional on static
credit**. An expected `should_stay_quiet` label is independent judgment, not
proof that the analyzer actually granted credit. A timeout or absent output is
not an `exposed` result either.

The pilot identified useful failure families and informed targeted repairs. It
does not establish that RIPR is generally safe, that silent over-credit is
absent, or that a zero-gap result can replace runtime verification.
[The current Python panel work](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/ripr-swarm/issues/3555)
requires exact replay identities, independent judgments and derived denominators.
[The Rust quiet-set audit](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/ripr-swarm/issues/3164)
separately samples credited and emitted behavior. Neither programme may inherit
a stronger safety or support claim from the historical seven-case result.
