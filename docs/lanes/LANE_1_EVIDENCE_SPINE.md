# Lane 1: Evidence Accuracy / Evidence Spine

Lane 1 owns RIPR's analyzer truth and the shared evidence spine. Its job is to
make behavioral test-grip evidence accurate enough to trust, structured enough
to reuse, and concrete enough to burn down toward RIPR 0.

Lane 1 follows this tracker, the evidence specs, capability matrix,
traceability manifest, and output contracts. It does not switch to another
campaign merely because `.ripr/goals/active.toml` points at a PR/CI, editor, or
policy surface.

The Lane 1 source-of-truth stack is defined in
[docs/lanes/README.md](README.md). This tracker records the evidence-spine
stabilization state; it does not replace proposals, specs, ADRs, capability
evidence, traceability, closeouts, or the active operator manifest.

This document is now the stabilization record for the shared evidence spine.
The next Lane 1 objective is Evidence Accuracy Evaluation, tracked in
[LANE_1_EVIDENCE_ACCURACY.md](LANE_1_EVIDENCE_ACCURACY.md).

## Scope

Lane 1 owns these evidence surfaces:

- seam identity and canonical behavioral gap identity;
- `seams[].evidence_record`;
- reach, activate, propagate, observe, and discriminate stages;
- observed values;
- missing discriminators;
- oracle strength and oracle semantics;
- related-test ranking;
- before/after evidence movement;
- static limitations;
- imported static/runtime calibration labels.

Downstream surfaces may consume this evidence, but they should not reinterpret
it independently.

For new Lane 1 work, use the layered source-of-truth model:

- proposal for why the evidence-quality work matters;
- spec for behavior contracts and acceptance examples;
- ADR only for durable evidence-model decisions;
- lane tracker for current slices and non-goals;
- capability matrix and traceability for proof;
- closeout handoff for what landed and what remains.

## Current Stable Spine

The shared evidence record is stable within its documented v0.1 scope.

The stabilized spine is:

```text
ClassifiedSeam
-> seams[].evidence_record
-> repo exposure
-> thin consumers with legacy fallbacks
```

Completed slices:

- `output: add shared evidence record` (#651) added
  `seams[].evidence_record` to repo exposure while preserving existing seam
  fields.
- `output: route zero surfaces through evidence record` (#654) made agent seam
  packets and RIPR Zero repair routes prefer the shared record when supplied.
- `output: route evidence movement through evidence record` (#658) made
  targeted-test outcome and agent verify compare record-level stage, value,
  discriminator, oracle, and related-test movement when present.
- `output: route assistant proof through evidence record` (#661) made assistant
  proof prefer the record for selected seam identity, recommendation, static
  limits, and movement context.
- `output: route baseline ledgers through canonical gap identity` (#664) made
  baseline and PR ledger identity carry semantic gap IDs when supplied.
- `fixtures: pin evidence record contract matrix` (#667) pinned the v0.1
  record shape across representative gap, oracle, limitation, canonical ID, and
  calibration-placeholder cases.
- `analysis: stabilize related-test ranking` (#671) made related-test ordering
  deterministic while preserving `related_tests_total`.
- `analysis: stabilize oracle semantics` (#677) explained what supported oracle
  shapes observe, miss, and can upgrade.
- `analysis: deepen local delta flow sinks` (#679) expanded syntax-first flow
  sink families for return, error, field, match, and side-effect paths.
- `calibration: label static runtime confidence` (#680) added imported
  static/runtime confidence labels without changing static classifications.
- `analysis: generate canonical gap identity` (#685) generated deterministic
  `canonical_gap_id`, group size, and grouping reason for headline-eligible
  gaps.
- `gate: prefer canonical evidence identity` (#697) made gate baseline
  comparison prefer supplied canonical evidence identity before legacy seam,
  source, and path/line/static-class identities. This is the final consumer
  closeout for the Evidence Spine Stabilization pass.

Gate authority remains unchanged; the optional gate consumer is now
line-movement tolerant when Lane 1 identity is available.

## Stable Fixture-Backed Analysis Slices

These Lane 1 analysis slices are stable within documented syntax-first scope:

- Local delta flow identifies visible return-value, error-variant,
  struct-field, match-arm, event/outbound-call, state-write,
  persistence-write, log-message, configuration-change, and generic call-effect
  sinks. Unsupported or opaque propagation remains `propagation_unknown` with an
  explicit static limitation rather than a stronger claim.
- Activation/value modeling records fixture-backed observed values and missing
  discriminators for visible equality boundaries, exact error variants, direct
  literal arguments, let bindings, same-file constants, table rows, rstest
  cases, builder or fixture override methods, enum variants, and one-level
  Option/Result constructor values. Cross-file constants, macro-heavy value
  generation, opaque helper calls, and unrelated builder methods remain
  unresolved or explicit static limitations rather than stronger activation
  claims.

## Calibrated Runtime-Backed Slices

These Lane 1 slices have checked imported-runtime calibration evidence for the
named classes. They remain advisory and do not run mutation testing.

- Static/runtime confidence labels are calibrated for the checked
  `runtime-fixtures-v1` classes: static gap plus runtime signal,
  static gap plus runtime clean, runtime signal without a static seam,
  static clean plus runtime clean, inconclusive runtime outcomes, ambiguous
  file-line joins, unmatched runtime data, static seams without runtime data,
  and seam-id or unambiguous file-line joins. The checked
  `runtime-fixtures-v2` sample expands imported-runtime calibration to
  side-effect observer, mock expectation, snapshot oracle, and dynamic or
  opaque dispatch classes while keeping ambiguous joins ambiguous and
  runtime-only signals out of static gap creation.

## Current Open PRs

At tracker creation, there are no open upstream Lane 1 PRs. Current open PRs
belong to PR/CI or editor projection lanes unless explicitly re-scoped.

When opening future Lane 1 PRs, list them here until they merge or close:

| PR | Slice | State | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none | - | - | - |

## Next Slices

Evidence Spine Stabilization is complete within v0.1 scope. The next Lane 1
work should measure and improve the evidence inside the spine, not wire more
consumers.

Track that work in
[LANE_1_EVIDENCE_ACCURACY.md](LANE_1_EVIDENCE_ACCURACY.md).

The only standing evidence-spine contract expansion slice is:

1. `fixtures: expand evidence record contract`
   - add cases only when a new evidence class or consumer requirement changes
     the v0.1 contract.

## Validation Gates

Docs and capability tracker changes should run:

```bash
cargo xtask check-doc-index
cargo xtask markdown-links
cargo xtask check-static-language
cargo xtask check-capabilities
cargo xtask check-traceability
cargo xtask check-pr
git diff --check
```

Evidence behavior changes should add the relevant checks:

```bash
cargo test -p ripr evidence_record --lib
cargo test -p ripr canonical_gap --lib
cargo test -p ripr repo_exposure --lib
cargo test -p ripr agent_seam_packets --lib
cargo test -p ripr outcome --lib
cargo xtask fixtures
cargo xtask goldens check
cargo xtask check-fixture-contracts
cargo xtask check-output-contracts
cargo xtask check-static-language
cargo xtask check-traceability
cargo xtask check-capabilities
cargo xtask check-pr
git diff --check
```

## Cross-Lane Rules

- `.ripr/goals/active.toml` is the current Codex Goals manifest, not the whole
  product board. Its top-level status may be `closed` after campaign closeout
  until a successor campaign is selected.
- Lane 1 may add or change evidence consumed by PR/CI, editor, agent, baseline,
  or gate surfaces.
- Lane 1 should not implement PR/CI summary projection, editor UX polish,
  policy defaults, release flows, or provider integration.
- Cross-lane reports should consume `evidence_record` or documented legacy
  fallback fields instead of rebuilding seam truth ad hoc.
- If a downstream consumer exposes an evidence gap, fix the evidence source in
  Lane 1 and keep the projection change narrow.

## Non-Goals

Lane 1 does not own:

- default CI blocking;
- PR comment posting;
- generated CI front-panel composition;
- first-useful-action docs, dogfood, or closeout;
- LSP/VS Code UX polish;
- CodeLens, inlay hints, or unsaved-buffer overlays;
- generated tests;
- source edits;
- provider or model calls;
- runtime mutation execution;
- release, packaging, or security workflow mechanics;
- badge hosting policy.

## Operating Rule

Before taking a Lane 1 task, confirm it changes analyzer truth, evidence
identity, evidence structure, evidence movement, or calibration confidence. If
it mainly renders, governs, distributes, or secures existing evidence, route it
to the owning lane.
