# Lane 1: Evidence Accuracy Evaluation

Lane 1's Evidence Spine Stabilization work is complete within the documented
v0.1 scope. The shared `evidence_record` is now stable enough for repo
exposure, agent seam packets, RIPR Zero repair routes, evidence movement,
assistant proof, baseline and PR ledger identity, canonical gap identity,
related-test ranking, oracle semantics, local delta flow, imported
static/runtime confidence labels, and gate baseline comparison.

PR #697, `gate: prefer canonical evidence identity`, is the final consumer
closeout for that stabilization pass. The next Lane 1 objective is no longer
more consumer wiring. It is evidence accuracy evaluation.

Status: closed in documented scope on 2026-05-12. See
[`docs/handoffs/2026-05-12-lane-1-evidence-accuracy-closeout.md`](../handoffs/2026-05-12-lane-1-evidence-accuracy-closeout.md).

The Lane 1 source-of-truth stack is defined in
[docs/lanes/README.md](README.md). This tracker records the closed Evidence
Accuracy Evaluation campaign; it does not make `.ripr/goals/active.toml` the
whole product board.

## Goal

Use the stable `evidence_record` to measure and improve evidence quality under
dogfood pressure. Lane 1 should answer:

```text
Where is RIPR's evidence still wrong, shallow, duplicated,
overconfident, underconfident, or uncalibrated?
```

The expected end state is:

- a dogfood evidence-quality report over current repo evidence;
- categorized top evidence-quality gaps;
- fixture-pinned high-impact duplicate groups, shallow related-test choices,
  static limitations, and calibration gaps;
- evidence-health consuming `evidence_record` consistently;
- calibration labels expanded only for checked fixture classes;
- capability promotions kept scoped to fixture-backed or calibrated evidence.

## Boundary

This campaign is measured expansion, not a new product surface.

Non-goals:

- no PR or CI front panel work;
- no PR review docs;
- no LSP or editor polish;
- no platform, MSRV, or dependency cleanup;
- no new gate policy;
- no default blocking;
- no provider integration;
- no generated tests;
- no mutation execution;
- no score redefinition.

Do not change `.ripr/goals/active.toml` for this lane unless the shared
tracker explicitly makes Lane 1 active. The repo-wide active manifest may point
at another lane without changing this Lane 1 plan.

For follow-on Lane 1 work, keep document responsibilities separate:

- proposal: why evidence quality leadership matters;
- spec: scorecard, benchmark, calibration, or report behavior;
- ADR: durable evidence-model decisions only;
- lane tracker: PR-sized sequence and current lane state;
- capability matrix: class-scoped maturity and proof;
- traceability: spec, fixture, test, code, and metric linkage;
- closeout: landed work, proof, and remaining unknowns.

## Planned Slices

| Slice | Intent | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs: open Lane 1 evidence accuracy evaluation` | Record evidence-spine completion and open this tracker. | No code behavior changes. |
| `report: add Lane 1 evidence quality audit` | Generate `target/ripr/reports/lane1-evidence-audit.{json,md}` from existing repo exposure and `evidence_record` data. | Implemented by `cargo xtask lane1-evidence-audit`; repo-local report only. |
| `fixtures: pin top evidence-quality failures` | Fixture the top 3-5 audit findings before changing analyzer behavior. | `fixtures/boundary_gap/expected/evidence-quality-failures/corpus.json` pins positive and negative cases. |
| `analysis: reduce duplicate canonical gap overcount` | Refine grouping only if audit and fixtures show duplicate groups are a top issue. | Implemented for parser-backed match-arm discriminators: same owner, seam kind, flow sink, and missing discriminator group together; different discriminators and owners stay separate. |
| `analysis: improve related-test ranking from audit cases` | Adjust ranking only for fixture-pinned misses from the audit. | Direct owner calls and stronger oracles remain primary; recency stays a tie-breaker. |
| `analysis: improve oracle semantics from audit cases` | Add supported oracle shapes only when the audit identifies misclassified cases. | Observed and missed behavior are explicit; unsupported helpers stay static limitations. |
| `calibration: expand runtime fixture classes` | Add checked runtime fixture classes for side effects, mock expectations, snapshots, and dynamic or opaque dispatch. | Implemented by `runtime-fixtures-v2`: runtime-only signal does not create a static gap; no CI mutation execution. |
| `report: evidence health consumes audit findings` | Fold durable audit fields into evidence-health. | Implemented as additive evidence-health fields; no policy decisions or blocking. |
| `campaign: close Lane 1 evidence accuracy evaluation` | Close after at least one audit-driven improvement lands. | Closed by `docs/handoffs/2026-05-12-lane-1-evidence-accuracy-closeout.md`; future work is listed by evidence class, not surface. |

## Evidence Quality Audit

The repo-local audit command is:

```bash
cargo xtask lane1-evidence-audit
```

The compatibility alias is:

```bash
cargo xtask evidence-quality-audit
```

It should write:

```text
target/ripr/reports/lane1-evidence-audit.json
target/ripr/reports/lane1-evidence-audit.md
```

The audit should summarize:

- raw headline gaps;
- canonical gap groups;
- largest canonical groups;
- duplicate-looking groups;
- missing discriminator classes;
- static limitations by reason;
- oracle semantics distribution;
- related-test ranking confidence;
- movement availability;
- calibration availability;
- calibrated versus uncalibrated classes;
- `evidence_record` missing or nullable fields;
- top files by unresolved evidence debt.

The audit should identify whether RIPR is overcounting equivalent gaps,
ranking weak related tests too highly, overstating broad oracles, missing
candidate values, or leaving calibration labels sparse. It should not change
gate behavior, PR or CI projection, LSP UX, analyzer claims, mutation execution,
or score definitions.

## Fixture-First Rule

After the audit lands, pick the highest-value real evidence-quality failure
modes and fixture them before analyzer changes. Candidate fixture classes:

- duplicate canonical gap overcount;
- wrong related-test top choice;
- missing equality boundary with nearby exact-value test;
- broad error oracle treated as stronger than it is;
- opaque helper that should remain a static limitation;
- cross-file constant that should remain unresolved;
- side-effect observer that should be recognized;
- runtime signal with ambiguous join.

Each fixture should state what RIPR should claim, what it should leave
unknown, and what must not be inferred.

The first fixture corpus is:

```text
fixtures/boundary_gap/expected/evidence-quality-failures/corpus.json
```

It pins audit-derived cases for duplicate canonical groups, missing
equality-boundary discriminators, activation static limitations,
mock-expectation observer semantics, and no-runtime-data calibration gaps.
`cargo xtask check-fixture-contracts` validates that each case includes the
audit signal, expected `repo-exposure-json` `evidence_record` subset, positive
claims, and `must_not_claim` guards.

## Audit-Driven Analyzer Improvement

The first analyzer improvement targets the audit-pinned suppressions match-arm
overgrouping case. Parser-backed match expressions now carry normalized match
heads such as `match key`, and match arms carry concrete arm patterns such as
`"kind" =>` instead of generic `match` or `=>` text. Canonical gap identity can
therefore split different match arms while still grouping the same arm across
line movement.

The local audit delta after the change was:

- duplicate-looking groups dropped from `1287` to `926`;
- the generic `match_arm` duplicate-looking group disappeared from the top
  audit rows;
- generic static limitation reasons for `=>` and `match` disappeared;
- the suppressions fixture seam `205829e99ffbd3ca` now records `"kind" =>` with
  canonical group size `1`.

## Calibration Rule

The existing checked `runtime-fixtures-v1` classes define the calibrated
boundary for imported static/runtime confidence labels over the main agreement
buckets. The checked `runtime-fixtures-v2` sample expands that boundary to
side-effect observer, mock expectation, snapshot oracle, and dynamic or opaque
dispatch classes.

When expanding calibration:

- map imported runtime outcomes to existing static seams where possible;
- keep ambiguous joins ambiguous;
- do not create a static gap from runtime-only signal;
- keep static vocabulary within RIPR's conservative terms;
- do not run mutation execution in CI.

The v2 fixture keeps those rules explicit: imported runtime outcomes map to
existing side-effect, mock, snapshot, and opaque-dispatch seams where possible;
an opaque dispatch file/line signal with two candidates remains ambiguous; and
a runtime-only signal stays in the calibration report without creating a
static gap.

## Evidence Health Audit Fields

Evidence health now carries the durable audit fields that should remain visible
between full Lane 1 audit runs:

- canonical gap group totals and the largest canonical groups;
- duplicate-looking group count;
- actionability class distribution from `evidence_record.actionability`;
- static limitation stage and reason distributions from
  `evidence_record.static_limitations`;
- evidence-record calibration availability counts;
- movement availability for seam ID, canonical gap ID, complete evidence path,
  recommendation, and verify-command fields;
- top evidence-quality risks.

These fields are advisory dashboard data. They do not change analyzer
classification, gate policy, CI behavior, LSP output, mutation execution, or
score definitions.

## Closeout Conditions

This campaign is closed in documented scope. Closeout evidence:

- #761 added the repo-local evidence-quality audit, and #822 folded durable
  audit fields into evidence-health.
- #808 fixture-pinned the first audit-derived evidence-quality failure modes.
- #813 landed the first audit-driven analyzer improvement for match-arm
  canonical overcount.
- #827 expanded checked runtime calibration classes without mutation execution,
  gate behavior, or static gap creation from runtime-only signals.
- Capability and traceability metadata name the checked scope and avoid broader
  claims.
- Future work is by evidence class:
  related-test ranking misses, oracle-shape misclassifications, static
  limitation reason buckets, canonical grouping refinements, and new runtime
  calibration fixture classes.
