# Policy Operations and Promotion Readiness

Status: closed focused Lane 2 tracker

GitHub tracker: PR stack #859 through #922, closed by the campaign closeout.

This was the focused Lane 2 tracker for policy operations after
[Policy readiness](POLICY_READINESS.md). It is not the global active campaign
manifest. Campaign 28 is now closed and archived, and
`.ripr/goals/active.toml` records `no_current_goal = true` until a successor is
selected. This tracker records the policy-operations work that landed without
changing analyzer behavior, editor behavior, generated tests, mutation
execution, default CI blocking, config files, baselines, suppressions, or
preview-language gate eligibility.

## Mission

Make RIPR policy adoption operational.

Policy readiness defines what evidence is allowed to mean. Policy operations
should tell maintainers what policy posture is safe now, what blocks stricter
modes, what evidence would justify promotion, what changed over time, and why
preview-language evidence remains advisory until explicitly promoted.

The product of this tracker is policy trust. It is not more findings, editor
UX, PR-summary polish, generated tests, or default gate behavior.

## Objective

```text
Make RIPR policy adoption operational. The policy layer should not only say what
evidence means; it should tell maintainers what policy posture is safe now, what
blocks stricter modes, what changed over time, and what explicit promotion
packet would be required before baseline-check, calibrated-gate, or
preview-language evidence promotion. All outputs are read-only and advisory
unless an existing explicit gate mode is configured. No analyzer behavior,
editor behavior, generated tests, mutation execution, default CI blocking,
automatic baseline adoption, automatic config mutation, or preview evidence
promotion may occur in this campaign.
```

## Inputs

Policy operations consumes existing Lane 2 and policy artifacts:

- policy readiness;
- waiver aging;
- suppression health;
- baseline debt delta;
- gate decision;
- recommendation calibration;
- mutation calibration when explicitly supplied;
- preview evidence boundary metadata.

The tracker must not invent hidden analysis. Missing inputs should become
warnings or unknowns in read-only packets.

## End State

A maintainer should be able to generate advisory packets that answer:

- What is the current safe policy ceiling?
- What is the next safe policy action?
- Which target modes are safe now?
- Which target modes are blocked, and why?
- Which baseline, waiver, suppression, calibration, or preview-boundary repairs
  come first?
- What changed over time?
- What exact promotion packet would justify a manual policy change?
- Why does preview TypeScript or Python evidence remain visible but non-gating?

Example target shape:

```text
Current safe ceiling: ready_for_acknowledgeable
Target mode: baseline-check
Allowed now: no

Why not:
- baseline has stale entries
- suppression health has warnings
- waiver aging shows repeated PR-time acknowledgements
- preview evidence is present but not promoted
- calibration is insufficient for this class

Next safe action:
- shrink baseline
- review stale suppressions
- keep preview evidence advisory
- collect same-class calibration receipts
```

## Work Items

Spec numbers are assigned by current `main`, not by older local transcripts.
At tracker opening, `RIPR-SPEC-0034` through `RIPR-SPEC-0037` are already used
by other lanes, so the policy operations spec PRs should take the next
available spec IDs.

## Planned Report Surface

The policy operations report is defined by
[RIPR-SPEC-0039](../specs/RIPR-SPEC-0039-policy-operations-report.md). The
implementation is read-only and explicit about input artifacts:

```bash
ripr policy operations \
  --policy-readiness target/ripr/reports/policy-readiness.json \
  --waiver-aging target/ripr/reports/waiver-aging.json \
  --suppression-health target/ripr/reports/suppression-health.json \
  --baseline-delta target/ripr/reports/baseline-debt-delta.json \
  --gate-decision target/ripr/reports/gate-decision.json \
  --recommendation-calibration target/ripr/reports/recommendation-calibration.json \
  --mutation-calibration target/ripr/reports/mutation-calibration.json \
  --out target/ripr/reports/policy-operations.json \
  --out-md target/ripr/reports/policy-operations.md
```

Expected output paths:

- `target/ripr/reports/policy-operations.json`;
- `target/ripr/reports/policy-operations.md`;
- `target/ripr/reports/policy-history.json`;
- `target/ripr/reports/policy-history.md`;
- `target/ripr/reports/policy-promotion-*.json`;
- `target/ripr/reports/policy-promotion-*.md`;
- `target/ripr/reports/preview-promotion-*.json`;
- `target/ripr/reports/preview-promotion-*.md`.

The policy history report is defined by
[RIPR-SPEC-0041](../specs/RIPR-SPEC-0041-policy-history-ledger.md). It remains
read-only and turns the current operations packet plus optional history JSONL
into trend context:

```bash
ripr policy history \
  --current target/ripr/reports/policy-operations.json \
  --history .ripr/policy-history.jsonl \
  --commit HEAD \
  --pr-number 123 \
  --out target/ripr/reports/policy-history.json \
  --out-md target/ripr/reports/policy-history.md
```

The implemented command does not append to `.ripr/policy-history.jsonl`, collect
telemetry, create dashboards, execute gates, mutate policy files, or promote
preview evidence.

The policy promotion packet is defined by
[RIPR-SPEC-0042](../specs/RIPR-SPEC-0042-policy-promotion-packets.md). It
remains read-only and turns policy operations plus optional policy history into
manual-review promotion evidence:

```bash
ripr policy promote \
  --to baseline-check \
  --operations target/ripr/reports/policy-operations.json \
  --history target/ripr/reports/policy-history.json \
  --out target/ripr/reports/policy-promotion-baseline-check.json \
  --out-md target/ripr/reports/policy-promotion-baseline-check.md
```

The packet defines `allowed_now`, `why_or_why_not`, required repairs, required
receipts, rollback path, and a manual-only example config change. It must not
mutate `ripr.toml`, baselines, suppressions, workflows, branch protection,
history ledgers, generated CI defaults, or preview-language eligibility.
`ripr policy promote` now writes those JSON and Markdown packets from explicit
policy operations and optional policy history inputs.

## Promotion Ceiling

Promotion packets should use policy operations as the ceiling:

| Current ceiling | Safe target modes |
| --- | --- |
| `advisory_only` | none |
| `ready_for_visible_only` | `visible-only` |
| `ready_for_acknowledgeable` | `visible-only`, `acknowledgeable` |
| `ready_for_baseline_check` | `visible-only`, `acknowledgeable`, `baseline-check` |
| `ready_for_calibrated_gate` | `visible-only`, `acknowledgeable`, `baseline-check`, `calibrated-gate` for eligible stable Rust classes |

Preview-language evidence remains advisory unless a later preview promotion
packet justifies a narrow explicit promotion.

The preview evidence promotion packet is defined by
[RIPR-SPEC-0044](../specs/RIPR-SPEC-0044-preview-evidence-promotion-packet.md).
`ripr policy preview-promote --language ... --class ...` writes the packet with
default `allowed_now = false`, explicit required/supplied/missing evidence
accounting, advisory generated-CI posture, rollback guidance, and no actual
promotion, gate eligibility, RIPR Zero inclusion, calibrated confidence, CI
blocking, or preview eligibility mutation.

The maintainer workflow is documented in
[Policy operations workflow](../POLICY_OPERATIONS_WORKFLOW.md). It explains how
to run readiness, operations, history, promotion packets, and preview promotion
packets before any manual config review, and how to monitor policy health after
a reviewed change.

## Generated CI Advisory Projection

Generated CI may render, upload, index, and summarize:

- `policy-operations.{json,md}`;
- `policy-history.{json,md}`;
- `policy-promotion-*.{json,md}`;
- `preview-promotion-*.{json,md}` when TypeScript or Python preview adapters are
  configured.

These artifacts are advisory operator packets only. They must not decide
pass/fail, create required checks, post comments, mutate config, mutate
baselines, create suppressions, append history, change workflows or branch
protection, enable default blocking, or promote preview-language evidence.

## Closeout

Lane 2 now supports policy operations in the planned scope:

- current safe policy ceiling;
- next safe action;
- blockers to stricter modes;
- policy history and trend;
- read-only promotion packets;
- read-only preview-promotion packets;
- advisory generated-CI projection;
- no automatic policy mutation.

The closeout audit is recorded in
[Policy Operations closeout](../handoffs/2026-05-13-policy-operations-closeout.md).
No ready work item remains in this focused tracker. Future policy tightening or
preview-language promotion work should open a new focused policy tracker or spec
instead of extending this closed campaign.

## Lane 2 Reopening Triggers

This tracker is closed for policy operations. Do not reopen Lane 2 for UI
polish, PR front-panel rendering, queue cleanup, generated-artifact hygiene, or
documentation reshaping unless the work changes policy authority.

Open a new focused policy tracker or spec before changing any of these policy
surfaces:

- a new evidence class;
- a preview-language promotion request;
- gate eligibility expansion;
- baseline adoption policy;
- suppression semantics;
- calibration confidence promotion;
- static/runtime vocabulary.

Those changes can alter what evidence is allowed to mean. They need explicit
Lane 2 review before implementation.

## Boundaries

This tracker does not authorize:

- analyzer truth changes;
- evidence identity rewrites;
- recommendation ranking changes;
- LSP/editor behavior changes;
- PR/CI front-panel redesign;
- generated tests;
- provider calls;
- mutation execution;
- default CI blocking;
- automatic config mutation;
- automatic baseline adoption;
- automatic suppression creation;
- preview-language gate promotion;
- runtime-proof claims from static evidence.

## Source-Of-Truth Roles

- Policy trackers explain why.
- Specs define externally meaningful behavior.
- Implementation plans sequence PR-sized work.
- `.ripr/goals` manifests encode execution state.
- Policy ledgers hold exceptions and receipts.
- Traceability, capability, and output-schema files prove surfaces when the
  corresponding spec or behavior exists.
- Handoffs record what shipped and what not to do.

Do not collapse these roles into one document. In this tracker-opening PR,
traceability and capability entries were intentionally deferred until the first
policy operations spec existed, because the repo verifiers require those entries
to point at real spec files. RIPR-SPEC-0039 now supplies that first behavior
contract.
