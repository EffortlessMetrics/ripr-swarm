# Generated Evidence Discipline

Generated evidence is not authored copy. It exists to make review and
automation trustworthy, so ordinary PRs must not hand-edit generated counts,
reports, receipts, or local build output.

This page defines the boundary between authored source-of-truth, generated
evidence, deterministic repair, and judgment-required decisions.

## Ownership Model

| Surface | Owner | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| README badge links and layout | Human-authored docs | May be edited in docs or README PRs. |
| `badges/*.json` | Badge generation | Generated only by `cargo xtask badges` or the Badge Endpoints workflow. |
| `target/ripr/**` | Local or CI report generation | Never committed; upload or inspect as artifacts. |
| `crates/ripr/examples/sample/target/**` | Local sample build output | Never committed. |
| Specs, ADRs, plans, trackers, capability rows, traceability | Authored source-of-truth | Edited deliberately with the owning work item. |
| `target/ripr/reports/suggested-fixes.patch` | Deterministic repair hints | Generated only; authors may inspect or apply locally. |

The short rule:

```text
Authored truth lives in docs, specs, plans, policy, metrics, and source.
Generated evidence lives under target/ripr or explicit generated endpoints.
Deterministic repair is suggested by xtask.
Judgment-required decisions stop and name the owner.
```

## Badge Endpoints

Public badge endpoint JSON is generated evidence. Do not manually edit badge
numbers.

For a repo-scoped badge refresh:

```bash
cargo xtask badges
```

For a policy-backed `GapRecord` badge refresh:

```bash
cargo xtask badges --gap-ledger target/ripr/reports/gap-decision-ledger.json
```

or trigger the Badge Endpoints workflow and review the generated
`badge: refresh public endpoints` PR.

Ordinary docs, README, implementation, and refactor PRs must not carry
`badges/*.json` diffs. If validation creates local badge endpoint diffs as a
side effect, remove them from the PR unless the work item is explicitly a badge
refresh.

Use:

```bash
cargo xtask badges --check
cargo xtask badges --check --gap-ledger target/ripr/reports/gap-decision-ledger.json
cargo xtask check-badge-diff-policy
cargo xtask check-generated-clean
```

`cargo xtask check-badge-diff-policy` enforces the endpoint ownership boundary.
`cargo xtask check-generated-clean` rejects generated residue in ordinary PRs.

## Generated Report Artifacts

PR-scoped evidence belongs under `target/ripr/`:

```text
target/ripr/reports/
target/ripr/receipts/
target/ripr/fixtures/
target/ripr/dogfood/
```

These files can be uploaded by CI, attached to a PR, or inspected locally. They
must not be committed as source-of-truth.

Common generated reports:

```bash
cargo xtask pr-summary
cargo xtask commands
cargo xtask pr-ready
cargo xtask reports index
cargo xtask receipts
cargo xtask receipts check
cargo xtask critic
cargo xtask suggested-fixes
```

`cargo xtask check-pr` refreshes the review packet and target-local reports,
but it must not leave tracked source diffs. If it reports generated residue,
follow the repair instruction from the report instead of editing counts or
reports by hand.

## Command Mutability Catalog

Run this when you need to know whether an xtask command may edit files, only
writes generated reports, reads external state, or requires judgment before use:

```bash
cargo xtask commands
```

The command writes `target/ripr/reports/commands.md` and
`target/ripr/reports/commands.json`. The catalog is generated evidence and
should not be committed. It is the review-facing map for mutating commands,
non-mutating checks, report-only commands, external-state reads, external-state
mutations, and argument-dependent commands.

`cargo xtask check-command-catalog` writes
`target/ripr/reports/command-catalog.md` and fails when that map drifts from the
help catalog or omits write/judgment details. The report is generated evidence
and should not be committed.

## PR Ready Packet

Run this before opening or updating a PR when you want one local repo-ops
packet instead of checking each hygiene report by hand:

```bash
cargo xtask pr-ready
```

The command writes `target/ripr/reports/pr-ready.md` and
`target/ripr/reports/pr-ready.json`. It composes worktree doctor, command
mutability, PR summary, critic, receipts check, suggested fixes,
generated-clean, and badge diff policy. The packet is generated evidence and
should not be committed. It does not replace `cargo xtask check-pr`.

## Deterministic Repair

Safe deterministic repair can be automated or represented as a patch:

```bash
cargo xtask shape
cargo xtask fix-pr
cargo xtask suggested-fixes
```

Current deterministic repair includes formatting, allowlist ordering, report
directory setup, PR summary generation, and narrow suggested patches for
allowlist ordering, docs index table ordering for specs and ADRs,
traceability behavior block ordering by spec ID, capability block ordering by
spec ID and capability ID, and command catalog ordering by xtask help order.

Suggested patches must never include:

```text
badge value edits
golden blessings
policy exceptions
baseline adoption
suppression creation
dependency exceptions
schema version changes
branch protection changes
preview-language promotion
```

Those require explicit authored decisions in the owning source-of-truth file.

## Judgment-Required Decisions

When automation cannot safely act, it should stop and name the owning surface.

| Decision | Owning surface |
| --- | --- |
| Golden output acceptance | Fixture expected outputs and blessing reason. |
| Policy exception | Policy allowlist or policy tracker with owner/reason/scope. |
| Baseline adoption or refresh | Baseline ledger and RIPR Zero workflow. |
| Suppression creation | `.ripr/suppressions.toml` with owner, reason, scope, and optional expiry. |
| Spec ID allocation | `cargo xtask specs next`, `docs/specs/README.md`, and traceability. |
| Capability status movement | `metrics/capabilities.toml` and `docs/CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md`. |
| Preview evidence promotion | Explicit Lane 2 policy tracker/spec and promotion packet. |
| Badge endpoint refresh | Badge Endpoints workflow or explicit badge refresh work item. |

Do not turn these into suggested patches or silent fixups.

## Standard PR Flow

For ordinary work:

```bash
cargo xtask shape
cargo xtask fix-pr
cargo xtask commands
cargo xtask check-pr
```

For repo hygiene and review context:

```bash
cargo xtask worktree doctor
cargo xtask pr-triage-report
cargo xtask gh-pr-status --pr <number>
```

For spec and source-of-truth movement:

```bash
cargo xtask specs next
cargo xtask check-spec-numbering
cargo xtask check-campaign
cargo xtask check-traceability
cargo xtask check-capabilities
```

A small PR means one semantic production delta, not low line count. Large
fixtures, docs, schemas, receipts, or traceability updates are acceptable when
they make that one delta reviewable.

## Cleanup Rules

Before committing an ordinary PR:

```bash
cargo xtask check-generated-clean
git diff --check
```

If generated residue is present, remove it from the PR rather than editing it:

```bash
git restore -- badges/*.json
```

Remove local target output with normal filesystem cleanup, for example:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force target\ripr
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force crates\ripr\examples\sample\target
```

Only run destructive cleanup against the intended generated directories.
