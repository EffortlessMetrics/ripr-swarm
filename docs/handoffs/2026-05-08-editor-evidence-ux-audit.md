# Handoff: Editor Evidence UX Audit

Date: 2026-05-08
Branch / PR: `docs-editor-evidence-ux-audit` / #589
Latest merged campaign context: #590 `spec: define baseline debt delta report`
keeps Campaign 17, RIPR Zero Adoption, active while Editor Evidence UX remains
queued.

## Queued Work Item

`campaign/editor-evidence-ux-audit`

The audit converts the queued Lane 3 idea into a single editor evidence
contract. It does not change analyzer behavior, LSP behavior, VS Code behavior,
generated CI, policy gates, output schemas, or public API.

The target loop is:

```text
diagnostic -> evidence hover -> related test -> context packet
-> one focused test -> verify -> receipt -> refresh
```

## Prompt-To-Artifact Checklist

| Requirement | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Diagnostic carries stable seam identity | `crates/ripr/src/lsp/diagnostics.rs` emits seam diagnostics with `data.seam_id`; boundary-gap pins the same seam in LSP diagnostics and agent packet fixtures. | Covered |
| Hover reads analysis state, not message text | `crates/ripr/src/lsp/hover.rs` resolves through latest analysis state and renders from `ClassifiedSeam`. | Covered |
| Hover explains next useful test context | Hover includes grip class, stage path, missing discriminator, related test locations, suggested test shape, packet and brief handoff commands, verify and receipt commands, static limits, and next step. | Covered by hover hardening |
| Actions are command-oriented and evidence-aware | LSP and VS Code actions expose packet, brief, assertion, related-test, after-snapshot, verify, receipt, and refresh paths; targeted-test brief, suggested assertion, and related-test opening are conditional on supporting evidence, and stale seam diagnostics fail closed. | Covered by action hardening |
| Context packet exists | `ripr.collectContext` can return an agent seam packet for a selected `seam_id`. | Needs canonical evidence packet |
| VS Code path is tested | Current tests cover registration, handlers, LSP-first context, related-test opening, malformed args, and restart behavior. | Needs live server smoke |
| LSP protocol path is tested | Framed protocol smoke covers server startup and real seam diagnostics for hover/actions after #569. | Needs full loop after context packet |
| Status and freshness exist | First-hour UX added status and action discoverability. | Needs explicit staleness contract |
| Boundaries are explicit | `docs/EDITOR_EVIDENCE_UX.md` repeats no source edits, generated tests, runtime mutation execution, runtime adequacy claims, or policy invention. | Covered |

## Next Lane 3 Work Item

`lsp/context-packet-command`

This is the next Editor Evidence UX behavior item when the lane is explicitly
activated or explicitly run in parallel. It is not the active machine-readable
`goals next` item while Campaign 17 remains active.

Add one canonical evidence context packet command from editor state. Keep it
bounded to existing seam evidence and shared command templates, with no source
edits, generated tests, LLM provider coupling, runtime mutation execution, or
runtime adequacy claims.

## Verification Run

## What Not To Do

- Do not change analyzer behavior in the audit PR.
- Do not add LSP or VS Code behavior in the audit PR.
- Do not add unsaved-buffer overlays, CodeLens, inlay hints, or semantic tokens.
- Do not generate tests or edit source from editor actions.
- Do not run mutation testing from the editor loop.
- Do not claim runtime adequacy from static evidence.
- Do not move gate adoption, baseline ledger, or generated CI behavior into
  this lane.
