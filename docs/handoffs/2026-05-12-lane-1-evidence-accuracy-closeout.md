# Handoff: Lane 1 Evidence Accuracy Evaluation Closeout

Date: 2026-05-12
Branch / PR: lane1-evidence-accuracy-closeout / #829
Latest merged PR: #827 calibration: add runtime fixture classes v2 (commit 7d9001f6)

## Current work item

Lane 1 Evidence Accuracy Evaluation is complete in the documented scope. The
lane moved from shared evidence-spine plumbing to measured evidence quality:

- #754 opened the Lane 1 Evidence Accuracy Evaluation tracker and recorded
  Evidence Spine Stabilization as complete.
- #761 added `cargo xtask lane1-evidence-audit` and the compatibility
  `cargo xtask evidence-quality-audit` alias.
- #808 pinned the first audit-derived evidence-quality failure corpus.
- #813 landed the first audit-driven analyzer improvement for match-arm
  canonical overcount.
- #822 folded durable audit fields into `ripr evidence-health`.
- #827 added checked `runtime-fixtures-v2` calibration coverage for
  side-effect observer, mock expectation, snapshot oracle, and opaque dispatch
  classes.

The campaign intentionally did not take PR/CI front-panel work, LSP polish,
gate-policy changes, generated tests, provider integration, mutation
execution, or default blocking.

## Evidence state

The lane now has:

- a repo-local evidence-quality audit over `evidence_record` data;
- fixture-pinned top evidence-quality failure modes;
- one audit-driven analyzer improvement with measured duplicate-group
  reduction;
- evidence-health fields for canonical groups, duplicate-looking groups,
  actionability, static limitations, calibration coverage, movement
  availability, and top evidence-quality risks;
- checked runtime calibration fixture classes for the v1 agreement buckets and
  the v2 observer classes;
- capability and traceability metadata that names the checked fixture scope.

The runtime calibration lane still imports supplied runtime artifacts. It does
not run mutation testing in CI and does not create static gaps from runtime-only
signals.

## Next work item

Future Lane 1 work should open only when a new measured evidence class needs
it. Candidate classes:

- related-test ranking misses found by the audit;
- oracle-shape misclassifications that are fixture-pinned first;
- static limitations that need more precise reason buckets;
- canonical grouping refinements beyond match-arm overcount;
- calibration fixture classes beyond `runtime-fixtures-v1` and
  `runtime-fixtures-v2`.

Do not reopen this lane for downstream projection surfaces. Those belong to
their owning lanes.

## Open decisions

- None for this closeout.

## Current blockers

- None.

PR #827 merged at 2026-05-12T16:55:40Z.
Merge commit: 7d9001f6ad2fdc1dc4ed32d0a0f700d14b324727.
Required CI, CodeQL aggregate, patch coverage, and Droid review were green.
Droid's only actionable finding was the RIPR-SPEC-0006 fixtures-array
traceability suggestion; it was fixed before merge.
