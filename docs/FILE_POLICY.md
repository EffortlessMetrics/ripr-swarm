# File Policy

Rust is the default implementation language for this repository.

Use Rust and `xtask` for repo automation, production logic, test harnesses,
fixture runners, release checks, and policy checks. Non-Rust programming files
are allowlisted exceptions, not casual additions.

## Approved Non-Rust Surfaces

Non-Rust files are allowed when they belong to an approved surface:

- VS Code extension TypeScript under `editors/vscode`
- GitHub Actions workflow and issue-template YAML
- fixture inputs used by analyzer tests
- documentation and snippets
- assets
- generated or lock files with a documented owner

The canonical allowlist lives in
[non-rust-allowlist.toml](../policy/non-rust-allowlist.toml).
`cargo xtask check-file-policy` consumes this TOML directly, so each exception
records its `surface`, `classification`, `covered_by` checks, owner, and reason
in one Rust-read policy file.

## Adding A Non-Rust Programming File

If a PR adds a non-Rust programming file, it must explain:

- why Rust or `xtask` is not the right place
- which approved surface owns the file
- whether the file is production, test, fixture, generated, config, or docs
- what CI or local check covers it

`cargo xtask check-file-policy` now applies two gates to programming-language
files such as `.ts`, `.js`, `.py`, and `.sh`:

1. the file must match the non-Rust allowlist; and
2. the file must match a Rust-coded retention rule for an approved runtime
   surface that cannot reasonably move to Rust.

Today, the only retained programming surface is the VS Code extension
TypeScript code and tests, because that client runs inside the VS Code
Extension Host and binds directly to VS Code's TypeScript API. Other repo
automation, release helpers, fixture runners, and policy checks should be
converted to Rust/`xtask` rather than newly allowlisted.

If the file does not match the current allowlist, update the allowlist with an
owner and reason in the same PR. If it is a programming-language file, also
update the Rust retention classifier in `xtask` or convert it to Rust.

## Shell Scripts

Shell scripts are denied by default.

Allowed cases are narrow:

- small workflow `run` blocks that call Cargo, `cargo xtask`, npm, or release
  actions
- documentation examples
- fixture inputs with an explicit fixture spec

Prefer:

```bash
cargo xtask release
cargo xtask ci-fast
cargo xtask check-file-policy
```

Avoid:

```text
scripts/release.sh
scripts/check.sh
scripts/generate-schema.py
```

## Workflow Shell Budget

GitHub Actions YAML is necessary, but workflow `run` blocks should remain small
or delegate to Rust/npm tooling.

Workflow `run` blocks may:

- call Cargo commands
- call `cargo xtask`
- call npm scripts under `editors/vscode`
- set simple variables
- upload or download artifacts through actions

Workflow `run` blocks should not:

- parse JSON with shell
- implement release logic inline when an `xtask` command would be clearer
- use `curl | sh`
- contain complex loops or branching without a policy exception

Known workflow budgets are tracked in
[workflow_allowlist.txt](../policy/workflow_allowlist.txt).

## Executable Bits

Checked-in executable bits are denied by default. Use `cargo xtask` instead of
checked-in scripts. Fixture exceptions must be explicit and documented.

Executable exceptions are listed in
[executable_allowlist.txt](../policy/executable_allowlist.txt). The list should
usually stay empty.

## Generated Files

Generated build output, downloaded release assets, archives, packaged VSIX
files, and local cache output should not be checked in.

Intentional generated artifacts must be allowlisted:

- Cargo and npm lockfiles
- fixture golden outputs
- future generated schema or metrics artifacts with explicit owners

Generated-file exceptions are listed in
[generated_allowlist.txt](../policy/generated_allowlist.txt).

## Dependency Surfaces

Dependency managers are approved only on explicit surfaces:

- Cargo workspace and package manifests
- the VS Code extension npm manifest and lockfile
- fixture input manifests used as analyzer inputs

New dependency manager files must be allowlisted with owner and reason. The
allowlist lives in [dependency_allowlist.txt](../policy/dependency_allowlist.txt).

## Process And Network Surfaces

Process spawning and network access belong in explicit adapter, tooling, release,
or extension surfaces.

Allowlisted process-spawn surfaces live in
[process_allowlist.txt](../policy/process_allowlist.txt). Allowlisted network
surfaces live in [network_allowlist.txt](../policy/network_allowlist.txt).

## Checks

Safe normalization:

```bash
cargo xtask shape
```

This sorts allowlist entries while preserving their headers. It does not add
exceptions or make policy decisions.

Run:

```bash
cargo xtask check-file-policy
cargo xtask check-executable-files
cargo xtask check-workflows
cargo xtask check-generated
cargo xtask check-badge-diff-policy
cargo xtask check-generated-clean
cargo xtask check-dependencies
cargo xtask check-process-policy
cargo xtask check-network-policy
```

These checks are also included in `cargo xtask ci-fast` and CI.
