# Editor Extension

The VS Code extension is a separate artifact from the Rust crate.

```text
Rust crate:
  ripr

VS Code extension:
  EffortlessMetrics.ripr

Open VSX extension:
  EffortlessMetrics.ripr
```

The `0.6.x` extension is a universal VSIX preview client. It resolves the
server in this order:

```text
1. ripr.server.path
2. bundled server binary, if present
3. downloaded cached server binary
4. verified first-run download from GitHub Releases
5. ripr on PATH
6. actionable error
```

It does not yet publish platform-specific VSIXs with bundled native binaries.

## Location

```text
editors/vscode/
```

This directory is intentionally outside the Cargo workspace. It is a Node/VS
Code extension package, not a Rust package.

## Requirements

The extension can provision the matching server automatically. Manual install is
still supported for offline or controlled environments:

```bash
cargo install ripr
```

## Install Paths

Normal editor installs should not require a separate `cargo install ripr` step.
Use one of these surfaces:

- VS Code Marketplace: install `EffortlessMetrics.ripr`.
- Open VSX: install `EffortlessMetrics.ripr`.
- Local VSIX smoke: run `npm run package`, then install
  `editors/vscode/dist/ripr-0.6.0.vsix`.

On activation, the extension resolves a configured, bundled, cached,
downloaded, or PATH server and writes the selected source to the `ripr` output
channel. `cargo install ripr` remains the manual fallback for offline, pinned,
or controlled environments.

## First Use

The editor path should not require report-format knowledge:

1. Install `EffortlessMetrics.ripr` from VS Code Marketplace or Open VSX.
2. Open a Rust/Cargo workspace, or a workspace with explicitly enabled
   TypeScript, JavaScript, or Python preview languages.
3. Check the `ripr` status bar item for server state, workspace state,
   analysis progress, stale analysis, analysis failure, recommended next
   action, or "no focused test gap found." (Internal status IDs such as
   `no-actionable-seam` and `first-useful-action` remain stable in the JSON
   contract.)
4. Let the saved-workspace analysis refresh or run `ripr: Restart Server`.
5. Open the Problems panel and hover a ripr-flagged change to inspect evidence.
6. Use `Copy Current Repair Packet`, `Copy Repo Gap Map`,
   `Copy Targeted Test Brief`, the agent copy commands, or
   `Open Best Related Test`.
7. Add one focused test and verify with the copied command chain or the CI
   artifact packet.

The extension owns normal first-run server provisioning. A separate
`cargo install ripr` remains a fallback for offline, pinned, or controlled
environments.

the local repair loop from diagnostic to gap state, bounded action, verify,
receipt, and refresh, see
[Editor gap cockpit workflow](EDITOR_GAP_COCKPIT_WORKFLOW.md). For the older
saved-workspace seam walkthrough, see

see [Static limits](STATIC_LIMITS.md).

## Settings

- `ripr.server.path`: explicit path to the `ripr` executable. Empty by default.
- `ripr.enabled`: enables saved-workspace diagnostics, hovers, status, and code
  actions. Defaults to `true`; set it to `false` for an explicit disabled
  editor status without starting the language server.
- `ripr.server.args`: arguments used to start the language server. Defaults to
  `["lsp", "--stdio"]`.
- `ripr.server.autoDownload`: automatically download a matching server when
  needed. Defaults to `true`.
- `ripr.server.version`: pinned server version. Empty means match the extension
  version.
- `ripr.server.downloadBaseUrl`: override the manifest base URL for internal
  mirrors.
- `ripr.check.mode`: preferred editor check mode for LSP diagnostics and
  context commands. Defaults to `draft`.
- `ripr.baseRef`: Git base ref used by LSP diagnostics and context commands.
  Defaults to `origin/main`.
- `ripr.trace.server`: language-server trace setting.

The extension passes `ripr.check.mode` and `ripr.baseRef` to the language server
as initialization options. Changing enabled, server, check, base-ref, or trace
settings restarts the client so the next diagnostic refresh uses the new
configuration.

## Status and Staleness

The status bar item and `ripr: Show Status` command name the current
saved-workspace state using user-readable copy. The underlying JSON keeps
stable internal status IDs so editor automation and tests stay deterministic.
`ripr: Show Status` also prints the workspace root, resolved server source and
command, editor selector set, enabled languages reported by the last server
refresh, and the next safe action for the current state. This is the first
place to check when no diagnostics appear.

- disabled by `ripr.enabled = false`
- workspace unresolved
- server unavailable
- analysis queued
- analysis running
- analysis complete (ripr-flagged changes present)
- no enabled languages (`[languages] enabled = []`)
- no focused test gap found (internal status ID: `no-actionable-seam`)
- actionable gap available from a trusted gap artifact
- already observed, with no local repair action needed
- preview adapter unavailable in the current server binary
- wrong-root, malformed, or unsupported gap artifact ignored
- stale because a Rust or preview-language buffer has unsaved edits
- analysis failed

When `target/ripr/reports/first-useful-action.json` already exists in the
workspace, the status item and `ripr: Show Status` also project its top action,
selected seam, missing discriminator, target, related test, verify command,
receipt command, warnings, fallback, and static-evidence limits. The extension
only reads that existing report, and ignores reports whose `root` does not match
the open workspace. It does not run `ripr first-action`, add new diagnostics,
edit source, generate tests, call providers, run mutation testing, or make gate
decisions.

The LSP model remains saved-workspace only. When a Rust buffer is dirty, the
extension keeps stale status visible, including when a first-useful-action
report is present, so diagnostics are not presented as fresh evidence for
unsaved text. Saving or closing the Rust buffer clears the stale marker and
queues the next saved-workspace refresh.

Preview-language static limits should be read before action language in hover
and status text. A static limit names what RIPR could not safely infer from
syntax-first evidence; it does not mean the editor ran mutation testing, edited
source, generated a test, or made the finding policy-eligible.

When gap cockpit artifacts are present, status and actions stay fail-closed:
wrong-root, stale, malformed, disabled-language, unavailable-adapter, and
out-of-workspace related-test states suppress repair actions and leave status
inspection or refresh as the safe next step.

When first-pr packet artifacts are present, `ripr: Show Status` and
`ripr: Diagnose Setup` can project the packet state from:

```text
target/ripr/reports/start-here.{json,md}
target/ripr/first-pr/start-here.{json,md}
```

The editor validates the JSON packet before showing stronger first-pr actions.
Missing, stale, wrong-root, malformed, unsupported, path-unsafe, and
command-unsafe packets fail closed: repair, verify, receipt, and packet-copy
claims are suppressed, while refresh, setup diagnosis, or first-pr regeneration
guidance remain safe. A found packet is advisory and does not prove merge
readiness, runtime adequacy, mutation coverage, policy eligibility, or gate
status.

When actionable-gap queue artifacts are present, `ripr: Show Status` can
project the queue from:

```text
target/ripr/reports/actionable-gaps.json
target/ripr/reports/actionable-gaps.md
```

The editor validates typed JSON fields before offering queue actions. The queue
surface can name the top actionable gap, report-only groups,
static-limit-only groups, receipt state, first-pr state, and the next safe
action. Missing, stale, wrong-root, malformed, unsupported, path-unsafe,
command-unsafe, disabled-language, unavailable-adapter, receipt-mismatched,
first-pr-mismatched, and static-limit-only states fail closed: repair packet
actions are suppressed, while refresh, Diagnose Setup, or regeneration guidance
remain safe. See [Editor actionable gap queue](EDITOR_ACTIONABLE_GAP_QUEUE.md)
for the workflow and non-claims.

## Defaults-First Stance

The editor surface follows the defaults-first adoption contract in
[RIPR-SPEC-0009](specs/RIPR-SPEC-0009-defaults-first-adoption.md): diagnostics,
hovers, targeted-test briefs, context packets, best related-test navigation,
and refresh status should be discoverable without forcing users to understand
every report artifact first.

The current LSP model remains saved-workspace analysis. Unsaved-buffer overlays
are not enabled by default. The defaults-first target is useful bounded editor
feedback without requiring `ripr init`: saved-workspace diagnostics, hovers,
briefs, related-test navigation, and refresh status are available through
built-in defaults. `ripr init` is optional; when a team commits `ripr.toml`,
that repo policy makes the same defaults explicit and reviewable, or tunes them
quieter.

### Inspect Test Gap - Copy Context

The `ripr: Inspect Test Gap - Copy Context` command (command ID
`ripr.copyContext`) first attempts to collect context through the running LSP
server via `workspace/executeCommand` with `ripr.collectContext`. If the server
has a matching analysis snapshot, it returns a JSON context packet directly.
If the LSP command is unavailable or returns no result, the extension falls
back to shelling out to the `ripr` CLI (`ripr context --at <selector> --json`).

The code action `Inspect finding: copy context packet` includes `finding_id` and
`probe_id` from the diagnostic data so the server can resolve the finding
without re-running workspace analysis.

### Start Current Repair

The `ripr: Start Current Repair` command is editor-side orchestration over the
current projected gap. It selects the current or nearest `ripr` gap diagnostic,
asks the LSP for the existing code actions at that diagnostic range, and runs
one of those already-bounded actions. It does not read report files, parse hover
text, rerun hidden analysis, generate tests, edit source, or change gate
authority.

When a current repair is available, the command offers the same actions exposed
on the diagnostic: copy the first repair packet, copy the gap repair packet,
open the best related test, copy the verify command, copy the receipt command,
or copy a static-limit note. If only refresh/setup actions are available, the
command reports that no current bounded repair action is available.

### Actionable Gap Queue Actions

When `target/ripr/reports/actionable-gaps.json` validates for the current
workspace, the extension can expose two queue-oriented commands:

- `ripr: Copy Current Repair Packet`: copies one bounded work order for the
  top validated actionable gap. The packet includes Task, Context, Repair,
  Verification, Receipt, Stop conditions, and Do not do sections.
- `ripr: Copy Repo Gap Map`: copies read-only orientation over actionable,
  report-only, static-limit-only, preview, receipt, first-pr, and no-action
  states.

These commands use typed fields such as `canonical_gap_id`, `language`,
`language_status`, `gap_state`, `repair_route`, `related_test`,
`verify_command`, `receipt_command`, `receipt_movement`, `confidence_basis`,
artifact freshness, and workspace root. They do not parse Markdown prose to
decide actionability.

The current repair packet is suppressed unless the queue item has a current
workspace match, repair route, safe verify command, receipt command or path,
workspace-local paths, fresh artifacts, and no blocking static limit. The repo
gap map remains orientation only and must not imply gate pass/fail, merge
readiness, runtime proof, mutation proof, coverage adequacy, or policy
eligibility.

### Seam Code Actions

When seam diagnostics are enabled and a diagnostic carries `seam_id`, the LSP
server can provide seam-aware code actions:

- `Inspect Test Gap - Copy Context`: copies the server-owned agent seam packet
  for the selected test gap through `ripr.collectContext`.
- `Write targeted test: copy brief`: copies a plain-language work order for
  adding one focused test from the same seam packet guidance.
- `Agent handoff: copy packet command`: copies the `ripr agent packet` command
  for the selected seam.
- `Agent handoff: copy brief command`: copies the `ripr agent brief --seam-id`
  command for the selected seam.
- `Verify after test: copy after-snapshot command`: copies the
  `ripr check --format repo-exposure-json` after-snapshot command for the
  current mode.
- `Verify after test: copy verify command`: copies the `ripr agent verify`
  command that compares the pilot before snapshot to the after snapshot.
- `Review result: copy receipt command`: copies the `ripr agent receipt`
  command for the selected seam.
- `Write targeted test: copy suggested assertion`: copies a concrete assertion
  suggestion from the seam packet.
- `Write targeted test: open best related test`: opens the strongest related
  test to imitate when one is available, then falls back to the
  highest-confidence related test.
- `Refresh Analysis - Saved Workspace Check`: asks the LSP server to refresh
  diagnostics with `ripr.refresh`.

The targeted-test, assertion, and related-test actions are conditional.
`Write targeted test: copy brief` is shown only when the seam has related-test
context or a concrete assertion suggestion.
`Write targeted test: copy suggested assertion` is shown only when the seam has
a concrete assertion suggestion, and `Write targeted test: open best related
test` is shown only when the current analysis snapshot can resolve a related
test location. Refresh remains available even when no diagnostic is selected.

The agent-loop copy commands are workspace-relative by contract. They use
`--root .` and the same `target/ripr/pilot` plus `target/ripr/agent` artifact
paths used by the operator cockpit and generated CI workflow, so paste them in a
terminal rooted at the open workspace. This keeps command text stable across
Windows and Unix workspace path separators, including workspace roots with
spaces, without needing shell-specific quoting for absolute workspace paths. If
a diagnostic is stale and its `seam_id` no longer maps to the current analysis
snapshot, the LSP does not emit agent-loop copy actions; refresh analysis first.

### Gap Cockpit Actions

When a diagnostic maps to a trusted gap or evidence artifact, the LSP server can
also project repair-oriented actions. These actions use typed diagnostic and
artifact fields such as gap identity, language status, related-test path,
repair route, static-limit kind, verify command, and receipt command. They do
not parse prose to decide what is safe.

Gap cockpit actions remain conditional:

- `Write targeted test: open best related test` appears only for a
  workspace-local related test in the current language.
- `ripr: Start Current Repair` only dispatches to the repair actions already
  produced for the current or nearest gap diagnostic.
- `Inspect Test Gap - Copy Context` and repair-packet actions appear only when
  gap identity and repair route exist.
- `Write targeted test: copy brief` appears only when there is enough evidence
  to describe one focused test.
- verify and receipt copy actions appear only when the command payloads match
  the current workspace contract.
- static-limit notes appear only when a limit is present.
- refresh remains the safe fallback when the server is available.

Stale, wrong-root, malformed, disabled-language, unavailable-adapter, and path
escape states suppress repair actions. The editor may explain the state in
status or hover, but it should not offer an unsafe packet.

### First-PR Packet Actions

First-pr packet actions bridge the local repair loop to the PR-facing
`start-here` packet. They consume existing packet artifacts only; the editor
does not run `ripr first-pr`, publish PR comments, compose generated CI
summaries, or decide gate state.

The command set is:

- `ripr: First PR - Open Packet`: opens the workspace-local Markdown packet
  when the JSON packet validates and the Markdown path exists.
- `ripr: First PR - Copy Summary`: copies an advisory summary for safe found
  packet states.
- `ripr: First PR - Copy Repair Packet`: copies a bounded work packet only when
  the current diagnostic identity matches the packet gap identity.
- `ripr: First PR - Copy Verify Command`: copies the validated verify command
  for the matching current diagnostic.
- `ripr: First PR - Copy Receipt Command`: copies the validated receipt command
  for the matching current diagnostic.
- `ripr: First PR - Copy Regeneration Guidance`: copies guidance for missing,
  stale, blocked, or no-action packet states without running the command.

The diagnostic-scoped actions match typed fields such as `canonical_gap_id` and
`gap_id`; they do not infer identity from hover or Markdown prose. Treat
preview-language first-pr packets as preview evidence: syntax-first, advisory,
static-limit bounded, and not Rust-level confidence.

## Missing Server Behavior

If no usable server can be resolved, the extension shows:

```text
ripr server is not available. Enable automatic download, install with `cargo install ripr`, or set `ripr.server.path`.
```

Actions:

- Open Settings
- Copy Install Command
- Retry

The extension does not auto-install Rust or Cargo. It only downloads verified
release archives when `ripr.server.autoDownload` is enabled.

## Local Gates

```bash
cd editors/vscode
npm ci
npm run compile
npm run package
npm run test:e2e
code --install-extension dist/ripr-0.6.0.vsix --force
```

Manual smoke:

```text
Open a Rust workspace with Cargo.toml.
Confirm the extension activates.
Open the ripr output channel.
Confirm the resolved server source is logged.
Confirm ripr lsp --stdio starts.
Confirm diagnostics can arrive from saved-workspace analysis.
Confirm hover evidence, `Write targeted test: copy brief`, and
`Write targeted test: open best related test` are available on seam diagnostics
when the analysis snapshot includes the required data.
Confirm missing-server state gives the documented actionable message.
Confirm Restart Server, Show Output, and Open Settings work.
```

## Diagnostic Refresh Model

The preview LSP server currently analyzes the saved workspace diff. It stores
open document text for future hover/actions work, but unsaved edits are not yet
used as analyzer overlays.

Diagnostics refresh when a document opens, when a document is saved, or when the
`ripr.refresh` LSP command runs. Text changes update server document state but
do not trigger full workspace analysis until the change is saved or refreshed
explicitly.

The server logs refresh lifecycle messages to the LSP output stream. A normal
refresh logs when analysis starts and when it completes. Completion logs include
the refresh duration, total diagnostic count, finding count, seam diagnostic
count, published file count, and cleared file count. If a newer refresh
supersedes an older one, the older result is not published.

Refresh failures clear previously published diagnostics and log a warning with
the failure reason. Normal refreshes and one-off failures do not show user-facing
popups; the output stream is the intended place to inspect refresh state.

## Diagnostic Data

LSP diagnostics include a stable JSON `data` payload for editor commands:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "0.1",
  "finding_id": "probe:src/pricing.rs:88:predicate",
  "probe_id": "probe:src/pricing.rs:88:predicate",
  "classification": "weakly_exposed",
  "probe_family": "predicate",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "source_range": {
    "file": "src/pricing.rs",
    "line": 88,
    "column": 1
  }
}
```

Diagnostics remain advisory. `exposed`, `propagation_unknown`, and
`static_unknown` findings are informational; weak or missing exposure findings
are warnings.

## Hover Content

When the cursor is on a diagnostic range and a matching analysis snapshot is
available, the hover renders evidence-rich finding content:

```text
**ripr** `weakly_exposed`

Add an exact boundary assertion.

## RIPR Evidence

* reach yes: related tests found
* infection yes: predicate can alter branch behavior
* propagation yes: branch influences return value
* observation weak: return value asserted
* discriminator weak: boundary value missing

## Related Tests

- `tests/pricing.rs:12` `discount_boundary_is_exact` — strong exact_value oracle: assert_eq!(total, expected)

## Weakness

- no equality-boundary case was found

---
Analysis snapshot: generated 2 seconds ago; last refresh took 138 ms.
```

Fallback behavior preserves three levels:

1. **Snapshot + matching finding** — evidence-rich hover with RIPR stage
   summaries, related tests, weakness notes, and snapshot age.
2. **Diagnostic without matching finding** — diagnostic-only hover showing the
   classification, message, and finding or probe identifiers.
3. **No diagnostic at position** — generic guidance hover.

Seam hovers use the same snapshot footer when a matching seam diagnostic is
available. They also include a `Why this diagnostic?` section that makes the
static classification legible:

```text
## Why this diagnostic?
Grip class: `weakly_gripped` — the current static evidence has a weak discriminator or a named missing discriminator.

Strong evidence:
- reach yes: related tests reach discounted_total
- observation yes: exact value assertion exists

Weak / missing evidence:
- discrimination weak: equality boundary missing
- missing discriminator `discount_threshold (equality boundary)`: observed values do not include the equality-boundary case

## Suggested test shape
- file: `tests/pricing.rs`
- name: `discounted_total_boundary_discriminator`
- assertion shape: assert_eq!(discounted_total(/* discount_threshold (equality boundary) */), /* expected */)

## First useful action
- status: `actionable`
- action: `write_focused_test`
- title: Add equality-boundary discriminator test
- target: `tests/pricing.rs`
- verify: `ripr agent verify --root . --json`
- receipt: `ripr agent receipt --root . --json`

## Handoff, verify, and receipt commands
- packet: `ripr agent packet --root . --seam-id <seam-id> --json > target/ripr/agent/agent-packet.json`
- brief: `ripr agent brief --root . --seam-id <seam-id> --json > target/ripr/agent/agent-brief.json`
- after snapshot: `ripr check --root . --base <base-ref> --mode <mode> --format repo-exposure-json > target/ripr/pilot/after.repo-exposure.json`
- verify: `ripr agent verify --root . --before target/ripr/pilot/repo-exposure.json --after target/ripr/pilot/after.repo-exposure.json --json > target/ripr/agent/agent-verify.json`
- receipt: `ripr agent receipt --root . --verify-json target/ripr/agent/agent-verify.json --seam-id <seam-id> --json --out target/ripr/agent/agent-receipt.json`

## Limits
- Static evidence only; this hover does not run mutation testing or prove runtime adequacy.

Recommended next move: Add an exact-value assertion for the equality boundary.
```

The first-useful-action block appears only when
`target/ripr/reports/first-useful-action.json` exists, matches the current
workspace root, and selects the same seam ID as the hover diagnostic.

This keeps saved-workspace staleness visible without claiming that unsaved
document text has been analyzed.

## VS Code Extension Tests

Smoke tests run inside a real VS Code instance via `@vscode/test-electron`:

```bash
cd editors/vscode
npm ci
npm run test:e2e
```

The suite activates the extension in a fixture Rust workspace and verifies
command registration, defaults-first `draft` mode, LSP-first seam context
collection with CLI fallback, targeted-test brief copying, suggested assertion
copying, related-test opening, malformed command argument handling, and
`restartServer` callability. When a test server path is supplied, the suite also
opens the boundary-gap and editor gap cockpit fixtures through the real server
path, waits for diagnostics, checks hover evidence and static-limit ordering,
checks bounded actions, copies packet, verify, and receipt payloads, and opens
the best related test only when the path is safe. Agent-loop command copy
handlers fail closed unless the payload matches the expected label, root, base,
mode, identity, and target artifact contract. CI runs the suite headless with
`xvfb-run`.

## Current Limitations

The preview extension does not yet provide:

- bundled native server binaries
- platform-specific VSIX packages
- automatic Rust or Cargo installation
- deep editor UI beyond diagnostics, evidence hovers, code actions, and basic
  commands
- unsaved-buffer analysis overlays
