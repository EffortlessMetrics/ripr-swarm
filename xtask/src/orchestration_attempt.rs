//! Orchestration attempt receipts contract (#4925, RIPR-SPEC-0212).
//!
//! Typed, versioned DTOs for one governed orchestration attempt:
//! `OrchestrationAttemptV1`, `OrchestrationCorpusV1`, `AttemptStrategyV1`,
//! `AttemptDispositionV1` and `AttemptComparisonV1`, plus the fail-closed row
//! validator that decides whether one committed attempt row may be counted.
//! The deterministic `OrchestrationScorecardV1` projection lives in
//! `crate::reports::orchestration` and derives from these row assessments, so
//! JSON and Markdown can never strengthen machine state.
//!
//! Counting law enforced here: synthetic mechanics evidence never enters real
//! denominators (the scorecard separates the two populations); one work item
//! observed through several roles remains one attempt (deduplication is the
//! scorecard's, keyed on `observation_key` with portable-identity agreement);
//! blocked, contradicted, stale, malformed, over-budget, verification-failed
//! and single-agent-preferred rows remain visible as rows or rejected rows; a
//! passing command with zero subjects is not verification; a builder claim
//! cannot become `verified_fact` without a matching independent receipt;
//! missing required overflow makes the row incomplete; and a claimed
//! `completed` disposition is downgraded deterministically when synthesis,
//! verification, cleanup, boundary, contradiction or rejected-claim evidence
//! does not support it.
//!
//! Volatile durations, PIDs, scratch roots and API request IDs stay outside
//! this contract entirely: they are host-local telemetry, never portable
//! semantic identity. The one retained host-local spelling is each claim's
//! `worktree_root`, which binds the row digest (retained evidence) but never
//! the portable identity, so equivalent roots at equivalent inputs share one
//! portable identity.
//!
//! The validator runs no agent, selects no work and decides no strategy
//! verdict; a counted row claims only that this contract's identity,
//! disposition, denominator, verification and cleanup evidence is complete
//! and internally consistent.
