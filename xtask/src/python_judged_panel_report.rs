//! Python judged PR panel report and adjudication (RIPR-SPEC-0092, #3555 PR C).
//!
//! `adjudicate` records a current independent judgment for one case under
//! `target/ripr/python-judged-panel/adjudications/<case_id>.json` without
//! touching the accepted panel: reviewer role and identity are required (flag
//! or `RIPR_PANEL_ADJUDICATOR`), at least one own evidence citation is
//! required, `must_not_claim` is echoed from the validated row, and RIPR's
//! replay candidate classification is stored only as a separately named
//! advisory reference — never as the adjudicator's ground truth. A case
//! counts as adjudicated only with judgments from at least two distinct
//! recorded roles and identities (independence is self-claimed, not
//! mechanically verified); one role stays
//! `pending_second_role`, role disagreement is `disputed`, and an agreeing
//! judgment with no direction-admitted error axis decided is `inconclusive`
//! — never a pass.
//!
//! `report` derives deterministic JSON + Markdown from the validated
//! inventory, the replay records, and the adjudication records. Every rate
//! carries its exact numerator, denominator, coverage boundary, denominator
//! case ids, and the as-of identity bound by those cases' own replay
//! records; no denominator means no
//! rate (the rate key is omitted, never a fake zero). The two-error lattice
//! stays separate — no combined quality score exists anywhere. Replay
//! mismatches are advisory divergence data and never enter a rate or a
//! threshold. Threshold evaluation runs only when an explicit
//! `--threshold-policy <file>` is supplied, emits
//! `pass`/`fail`/`not_evaluable` per threshold, echoes the policy's own
//! rationale and authority, and is non-authoritative by construction: the
//! report never selects a threshold from observed results, never promotes
//! support, and writes no tier claim. Both renderings come from one derived
//! Value; volatile record fields (recorded command line, temp workspace
//! paths, stderr detail) and adjudication timestamps are never echoed, so
//! independent replay runs over identical inputs render identical bytes
//! (`report_bytes_are_stable_across_independent_runs`).
