//! Managed currentness-bound external sweep refresh — `cargo xtask eval-sweep
//! refresh` (RIPR-SPEC-0086, issue #3566).
//!
//! The historical Tier A sweep receipt is not current for promotion. This route
//! reruns the exact accepted eight-subject denominator against one explicit
//! RIPR binary and writes CANDIDATE artifacts outside accepted/current state:
//! every subject receives one terminal candidate row in the schema-0.3 receipt
//! shape `eval_sweep_check` validates, plus a managed execution receipt naming
//! the binary, manifest, host class, network authorization, and exact subject
//! identities.
//!
//! The route consumes #3565's validated subjects directly
//! (`eval_sweep_check::validate_accepted_manifest` — one loader owns manifest
//! semantics; refresh never re-parses), and it self-validates its own candidate
//! receipt through `eval_sweep_check::validate_run_receipt` before writing a
//! byte, so a produced candidate and `eval-sweep check --runs <candidate>`
//! agree by construction. That symmetry — refresh produces exactly what check
//! validates — is the core proof of this route, exercised offline by the
//! `python_eval_sweep_refresh` tests with synthetic local subjects (local
//! seed clones through git's local transport, never a network run).
//!
//! Honesty boundaries, each load-bearing:
//!
//! - Authorization gate: the route refuses without BOTH the managed env signal
//!   (`RIPR_EVAL_SWEEP_NETWORK=1`) and the explicit `--allow-network` flag.
//!   Ordinary CI never refreshes live repositories; the refusal is typed and
//!   names the missing signals.
//! - Candidate separation: `--out` is mandatory and rejected when it equals or
//!   overlaps accepted state (the `fixtures/` tree, or the repository root
//!   itself). The comparison runs on canonicalized paths on both sides, so a
//!   `--out` symlink resolving into accepted state is refused too. A candidate
//!   receipt cannot rewrite expected status, subject selection, the historical
//!   receipt, or the current pointer; promotion is #3567's validator/publisher,
//!   not this route.
//! - Explicit binary: `--ripr-bin` is mandatory and must name an existing file;
//!   the route resolves it to an absolute path before any invocation, so PATH
//!   can never select an installed binary. The binary's content identity is
//!   re-verified after EACH subject's run: a concurrent rebuild is a typed
//!   `tempfail` row disposition named in the execution receipt — never a
//!   silent stale digest over changed bytes.
//! - Subjects remain selected after ANY failure: materialization, input,
//!   infrastructure, parse, timeout, unsupported, partial, and stale outcomes
//!   all stay rows in the candidate denominator under the owned 0.3 status
//!   vocabulary; infrastructure failures at or after materialization (cache
//!   creation, analysis spawn, raw retention, binary-identity drift) are
//!   contained as typed `tempfail` rows naming their cause, so the route
//!   ALWAYS produces the full candidate receipt denominator; a failed row
//!   retains its available evidence and can never count as complete.
//! - Terminal states stay distinct: `complete`/`partial`/`parse-failed`/
//!   `timed-out`/`crashed`/`unsupported`/`tempfail`/`stale` are derived from
//!   producer facts (rail-enforced timeout, exit status, captured JSON,
//!   `analysis_outcome` kind and completeness) with no two outcomes merged.
//! - Stability: the route runs a second pass ONLY where the first result is
//!   `complete` — the one state where a gap/output identity comparison is
//!   meaningful — and records the comparison in the row's `repeat` block
//!   (stable) or its typed unstable list (mismatch); output-identity drift
//!   across passes is a typed execution-receipt note, never folded into the
//!   gap verdict.
//! - Missing identities are typed incomplete (disclosed in the candidate
//!   verdict), never invented: the route records only what a real producer
//!   observed (resolved HEAD SHAs, binary digest, version, exit codes, digests
//!   of captured bytes) and omits what it cannot observe (the analyzer source
//!   SHA of an arbitrary supplied binary, ripr feature sets without a
//!   producer, whole-tree sha256 digests git does not emit).
//! - Process hygiene reuses the existing controlled-execution rails only:
//!   every spawn — `ripr check`, `git clone`/`checkout`/`rev-parse`, the
//!   version probe — goes through the allowlisted `crate::run` bounded-capture
//!   helpers (wall-clock timeout, captured stdout/stderr, process-tree
//!   termination, cwd anchored inside the candidate tree, isolated
//!   `RIPR_CACHE_DIR`, terminal prompts disabled for git); no new
//!   process-spawn surface is introduced.
//! - Candidate publication is generation-staged: raw evidence and receipts are
//!   written under `<out>/.refresh-staging` and moved into their final
//!   locations by a single rename per file at finalization, so an interrupted
//!   refresh cannot leave a mixed old/new generation in the published paths.
//!   Full one-receipt-to-one-raw-set generation binding across reruns remains
//!   #3567's promotion contract.
//! - Claim boundary: a candidate receipt is structural currentness evidence
//!   over the retained denominator. Self-validation is structural — digest
//!   syntax, status vocabulary, and schema shape are what `eval-sweep check`
//!   accepts; the route does not recompute retained artifact bytes against
//!   their digests. That recomputation is the promotion-time binding #3567's
//!   validator/publisher owns. The receipt is not accepted promotion evidence,
//!   no structural-accuracy, repair-correctness, gate, badge, or support claim
//!   is inferred, and distributions stay descriptive (they never gate).
