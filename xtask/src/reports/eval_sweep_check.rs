//! Typed semantic validation for the accepted Python eval-sweep manifest and
//! retained run receipts — `cargo xtask eval-sweep check` (RIPR-SPEC-0086,
//! issue #3565).
//!
//! One loader owns manifest and run-row semantics here; the live-run path in
//! `eval_sweep.rs` keeps its lenient in-memory parse for sweeps, while this
//! module owns the accepted-artifact contract:
//!
//! - the accepted subject manifest (`python_eval_sweep_manifest`) must carry
//!   schema/kind/spec/tier and **exactly eight** uniquely identified subjects —
//!   the canonical denominator. Subject content is data-driven: any eight
//!   well-formed subjects validate, not just the retained fixture bytes.
//! - retained run receipts (`python_eval_sweep_report`) validate in two owned
//!   shapes: schema `0.2` (what `cargo xtask eval-sweep` writes today — the
//!   historical retained shape) and schema `0.3` (adds the currentness
//!   identities: binary/features/config/profile/input identity,
//!   materialization, detection, corpus-selection and execution states, the
//!   eight-word run status vocabulary, raw/output/evidence digests,
//!   repeat-run comparison identity, and a manifest-digest binding).
//!
//! Parser split (resolved with reason, #3733 review): the strict
//! duplicate-key-rejecting loader here is the check-path contract, while the
//! lenient in-memory parse in `eval_sweep.rs` stays the historical-tolerant
//! report path on purpose — the check path validates retained accepted
//! artifacts, the report path renders in-flight sweeps. The two converge
//! when #3566/#3567 own the refresh/report commands.
//!
//! Design laws (issue #3565 acceptance):
//!
//! - Fail closed on: duplicate or missing subjects, a changed denominator,
//!   unsafe (non-portable, absolute, or secret-bearing) paths, unknown state
//!   vocabulary, contradictory status (including a run-status row whose
//!   execution state says `not-executed`, and a false stability claim whose
//!   unstable list is omitted), disagreeing duplicate identity copies within
//!   one receipt, wrong-typed owned fields, malformed or stale digests, and
//!   hand-edited aggregates that disagree with the derived rows. Every
//!   failure names subject/field/reason and the deterministic rerun command.
//! - Aggregate agreement is checked in both directions. An analyzed
//!   (run-status) row must carry the aggregate source evidence the sweep
//!   records on every row it writes — `runtime_ms`, both distributions, and
//!   the 0.2 row-level `gap_ids_stable`; 0.3 stability lives in the optional
//!   `repeat` block, whose absence is typed incomplete — so a missing field
//!   can never silently disable a summary comparison. A recorded summary
//!   stability value over rows lacking 0.3 `repeat` stability evidence fails;
//!   unrecorded values are disclosed incomplete. Summary distributions must
//!   equal the row-derived key set exactly (zero-valued buckets included;
//!   with zero run rows a recorded distribution must still carry the full
//!   zero-filled key set the emitter writes — `absent` and `unknown`
//!   included — and every recorded bucket stays at zero), and
//!   the supplied `gate_status` must EQUAL the gate derived from the rows —
//!   `not_run` at zero runs, `pass` only with zero crashes and full stability
//!   evidence, `review` otherwise. Runtime totals and distribution merges use
//!   checked arithmetic: overflow is a structured failure naming the
//!   aggregate field, never a panic.
//! - The emitted summary is owned in full (#3733 review). With analyzed
//!   (run-status) rows, every summary aggregate the emitter writes must be
//!   present — a deleted field would silently disable its row-agreement
//!   check. Stability aggregates are required exactly when the rows fully
//!   evidence stability; the under-evidenced path discloses instead of
//!   failing on an omission the emitter could not have written. With zero
//!   run rows the `not_run`/not-a-vacuous-pass law extends to the summary:
//!   every analysis-bearing aggregate (classification/alignment counts,
//!   runtime min/median/max/total, stability counts and rate) must be zero
//!   or absent — any nonzero value is a fabricated claim about rows that
//!   never ran.
//! - Identity binding is symmetric (#3733 review). When the accepted
//!   manifest and the receipt both record a comparable identity (`license`,
//!   `tree_digest`, `snapshot`, `provenance`, `retention_class`) and both
//!   are well-formed, they must match — a mismatch fails naming both sides;
//!   a receipt value with no manifest side to bind discloses `incomplete` on
//!   the manifest side instead of fabricating a binding. Optional manifest
//!   identities are either absent (typed incomplete) or well-formed: an
//!   explicit null, an empty string, or a malformed value fails, because a
//!   present-but-garbage identity is not an absent one. Absent
//!   `ripr.features` / `binary.features` disclose incomplete;
//!   present-but-malformed feature sets fail — as does a present `binary`
//!   block missing any of its owned fields (each is a named incomplete
//!   disclosure). Within one receipt, duplicate copies of the same identity
//!   must agree: the row-level `tree_digest`/`snapshot` vs the `repository`
//!   block, and a row's `binary` identity vs the receipt-level `ripr` block —
//!   a disagreement fails naming both locations.
//! - The accepted-manifest schema is closed. The owned top-level keys are
//!   `schema_version`/`kind`/`spec`/`tier`/`description`/`limits`/
//!   `synthetic_diff`/`repos`; the owned per-subject keys are
//!   `id`/`url`/`sha`/`license`/`shape`/`synthetic_diff`/`why` plus the
//!   optional identity fields (`tree_digest`/`snapshot`/`provenance`/
//!   `retention_class`). The canonical fixture carries exactly these keys, so
//!   deny-unknown costs nothing and catches schema rot and typos; every key
//!   the canonical manifest carries is owned here.
//! - Failed, unavailable, timeout, parse-failed, unsupported, partial, and
//!   stale rows **remain selected**: they are valid rows and stay in the
//!   denominator. The validator never treats a bad outcome as an invalid row.
//! - Missing identities are typed `incomplete`, never invented and never
//!   errors — the retained fixture carries no provenance/retention/snapshot
//!   identities by design, and historical 0.2 receipts carry no currentness
//!   fields. Validation never upgrades or rewrites a historical receipt.
//! - `repos_run == 0` is `not_run`, never a vacuous pass: a receipt claiming
//!   `pass` with zero run rows fails, and a receipt-less check reports
//!   `not_run` (which is not a pass).
//! - `absent` stays distinct from emitted `unknown` distributions: a recorded
//!   `alignment_counts` object — row-level or summary, at zero runs included —
//!   must carry both keys separately.
//! - Accepted validation is offline: no repository materialization, no RIPR
//!   execution, and no filesystem lookups beyond the two artifact files
//!   themselves (diff-path existence is a run-time concern, not a structural
//!   one).
//!
//! Exit contract: `check` exits 0 when every present artifact is structurally
//! valid, disclosing `incomplete` identities and a `not_run` receipt dimension
//! in the verdict; it exits nonzero on any fail-closed violation. Top-level
//! verdict precedence spans BOTH artifacts: `not_run` only when no receipt is
//! supplied; with a receipt, `incomplete` whenever the manifest or the receipt
//! discloses incomplete identities (a complete receipt never hides manifest
//! gaps), and `valid` only when both artifacts are structurally valid and
//! carry zero incompletes. The verdict vocabulary is `valid` / `incomplete` /
//! `not_run` — a structural currentness-readiness verdict, never a robustness
//! or adequacy claim.
