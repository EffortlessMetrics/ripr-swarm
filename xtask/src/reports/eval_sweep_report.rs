//! Accepted-receipt publication and the mechanical currentness gate —
//! `cargo xtask eval-sweep report` (RIPR-SPEC-0086, issue #3567).
//!
//! A candidate sweep (#3566) is not accepted evidence until its rows,
//! identities, aggregates, non-complete dispositions, and currentness are
//! independently checked and projected through one durable receipt. This route
//! is that promotion step, deterministic and offline:
//!
//! - `eval-sweep report --candidate <receipt.json> [--dispositions <path>]`
//!   validates a schema-0.3 candidate through the exact `eval-sweep check`
//!   semantics (`eval_sweep_check::validate_run_receipt` — one validator owns
//!   receipt semantics; report never re-implements them), then renders the
//!   accepted receipt JSON and a bounded Markdown report derived from the SAME
//!   validated rows as a dry run. No accepted state is written.
//! - `... --accept` additionally appends the immutable accepted receipt under
//!   `<state-dir>/receipts/<receipt-sha256>.json` (content-addressed over the
//!   exact written bytes; an existing file is never overwritten — identical
//!   bytes are an idempotent no-op, different bytes are a typed refusal)
//!   together with the retained candidate
//!   (`receipts/<candidate-sha256>.candidate.json`, addressed by the
//!   candidate's own digest, so the currentness check can re-validate the
//!   rows through the shared validator) and atomically updates the current
//!   pointer `<state-dir>/current.json` to identify exactly that accepted
//!   receipt.
//! - `eval-sweep report --check-currentness` recomputes the identities the
//!   pointer binds against current state and reports the mechanical verdict:
//!   `current`, `stale`, `unverifiable`, or `not_run` (no pointer; never a
//!   pass). `current`/`unverifiable`/`not_run` exit 0 (with the non-current
//!   verdicts disclosed in full); `stale` exits nonzero — the gate signal
//!   that the accepted receipt must be re-accepted before promotion
//!   consumption.
//!
//! The current pointer contains NO independently editable totals — only
//! identity: the accepted receipt's digest and portable filename, an optional
//! as-of disclosure string, the manifest digest, the RIPR toolchain identity
//! block (source sha, binary digest, features, build profile), the
//! command-contract version, and per-subject bound identities (tree digest,
//! accepted-row digest, input digest, config identity). The currentness law
//! is mechanical: changed ripr source/binary bytes, a moved manifest, edited
//! accepted-row bytes, a moved subject tree pin, a substituted input path
//! (the bound config input must BE the manifest-declared input), moved
//! config/input bytes, or a different command contract flips the verdict to
//! `stale` — and editing
//! the as-of string can never repair it, because staleness derives only from
//! digest, binding, and vocabulary comparisons; as-of is never an input.
//!
//! Dispositions are acceptance-time judgment and live OUTSIDE the closed 0.3
//! row schema (which is deny-unknown): a sidecar file maps each non-complete
//! subject to one typed terminal disposition with an evidence reference and
//! an owner/recovery route. Every disposition type in the owned vocabulary is
//! actionable by definition, so owner and recovery route are required on
//! every disposition — a disposition without them fails closed.
//!
//! Honesty boundaries, each load-bearing:
//!
//! - Language: the accepted receipt reports counts, distributions, and
//!   dispositions. It stays inside the conservative exposure vocabulary and
//!   never labels an outcome as caught, missed, exercised, or sufficient.
//!   Robustness and distribution metrics are informational and never become
//!   judged accuracy; the receipt's `non_claims` section states this inside
//!   the artifact itself.
//! - Every count is emitted as `{numerator, denominator}` — no bare rate and
//!   no denominator-free number.
//! - Real producers only: what the validated rows record is projected; what
//!   they do not record is omitted (typed incomplete in the candidate's own
//!   disclosures, copied into the accepted receipt). A limitation
//!   distribution has no schema-0.3 row producer, so the accepted receipt
//!   carries a named disclosure instead of a fabricated taxonomy.
//! - Historical receipts stay immutable: a schema-0.2 candidate is refused
//!   with a typed refusal (it carries no currentness identities to bind), and
//!   acceptance never rewrites the retained historical receipt or any
//!   previously accepted artifact.
//! - Accepted-artifact hygiene: the rendered receipt, pointer, and Markdown
//!   are scanned before any byte is written — secret-shaped tokens (the
//!   shared validator tripwire list), absolute host paths, and oversized
//!   free-text notes fail closed.
//! - Claim boundary: acceptance establishes a current, reproducible
//!   operational-robustness denominator over the retained eight external
//!   Python subjects. It does not establish repair correctness and does not
//!   authorize any support-tier change.
