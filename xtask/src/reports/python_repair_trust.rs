//! Typed selection/attempt model and semantic validator for governed Python
//! repair attempts — `cargo xtask python-repair-trust check` (RIPR-SPEC-0176,
//! issue #3568).
//!
//! One crate-private loader owns selection, lifecycle, movement, execution,
//! currentness, and aggregate semantics for the external Python repair-trust
//! corpus:
//!
//! - the accepted **selection manifest** (`python_repair_trust_manifest`)
//!   fixes the denominator before outcomes are known. Every selection row
//!   carries the attempt/case/subject identity, the repository/base/head/tree
//!   pins with source currentness, the selection reason and diversity
//!   stratum, the native Python behavior identity (family/owner/
//!   discriminator/relation/oracle/limitation), the expected direction and
//!   claim boundary, the target state
//!   (existing/proposed/ambiguous/unavailable/unsafe) with its path, the
//!   selection timestamp/selector/authority-manifest digest, and an immutable
//!   `selection_digest` — recomputed over the row's canonical content, so a
//!   replaced or edited selected row fails closed.
//! - retained **attempt envelopes** (`python_repair_trust_attempts`) bind to
//!   the selection manifest by sha256 digest and carry the attempt lifecycle
//!   rows. Lifecycle states are
//!   `selected`/`eligible`/`started`/`edited`/`verified`/`reviewed`/
//!   `accepted`/`stale`/`rejected`/`abandoned`; terminal static movement is
//!   `closed`/`improved`/`unchanged`/`regressed`/`limited`/`stale`/
//!   `uncertain`; verification execution is a separate axis:
//!   `passed`/`failed`/`timed_out`/`cancelled`/`unavailable`/`not_run`/
//!   `invalid`.
//!
//! Design laws (issue #3568 acceptance):
//!
//! - Selection precedes edit/outcome: every lifecycle starts at `selected`,
//!   and the state machine ordering is enforced (edited needs started,
//!   verified needs edited, reviewed needs verified, accepted needs
//!   reviewed; discard terminals come last).
//! - Selected rows cannot be deleted or replaced after outcome: an attempt
//!   naming an unknown attempt identity fails, a replaced selection row fails
//!   its recomputed digest, and a manifest changed under a bound envelope
//!   fails the stale-digest check.
//! - Native Python behavior identity remains authoritative: `SeamKind` (the
//!   Rust-side conversion shim vocabulary) appears nowhere in a corpus value.
//! - Source/analyzer/config/input/packet/target/command/patch/after-state
//!   identities are required as lifecycle advances: claiming `started`
//!   requires the analyzer/config/input identities, `edited` the patch
//!   digest, `verified` the command and after-state identities, and
//!   `reviewed`/`accepted` the packet reference. Missing identities at their
//!   transition fail closed — they are not invented and not excused. The
//!   source and target identities live on the selection row.
//! - Static movement and command execution cannot imply one another: the
//!   axes are separate fields with no cross-axis derivation. A recorded
//!   movement requires an edited lifecycle (movement is a static
//!   before/after comparison of an edit — never a consequence of a run), a
//!   verdict execution (`passed`/`failed`) requires the `verified` state,
//!   and a non-verdict execution contradicts a claimed `verified` state. An
//!   improved movement never requires a passed run, and a passed run never
//!   forces improved — both pairings stay representable.
//! - Partial/stale/abandoned attempts cannot appear completed: a
//!   `stale`/`rejected`/`abandoned` terminal forbids the completed lifecycle
//!   states (`verified`/`reviewed`/`accepted`) and the completed movements
//!   (`closed`/`improved`).
//! - Production/generated/vendor/environment edit surfaces are forbidden: a
//!   target path under a denied surface prefix must be declared
//!   `target_state: unsafe`, and an attempt that edits an unsafe target
//!   fails. Existing/proposed/ambiguous/unavailable/unsafe targets stay
//!   representable — ambiguity, unavailability, and unsafety are states, not
//!   errors, until someone attempts the edit.
//! - Aggregates are derived from rows: every recorded total and count map
//!   must equal the row-derived value exactly (hand-edited totals fail);
//!   with zero attempt rows a recorded nonzero aggregate is a fabricated
//!   claim. Achieved diversity is reported from rows, and a recorded
//!   `stratum_floor_met` must equal the floor comparison — a floor that is
//!   not met is never reported as met.
//! - Historical attempts are immutable: attempt identities are unique
//!   across the corpus, and a refresh appends a new record under a new
//!   attempt identity linked through `supersedes` to a record that ended
//!   `stale` — never by mutating the historical row.
//! - No corpus yet: `check` with no attempts input exits 0 with verdict
//!   `not_run` and empty-denominator semantics — never a vacuous pass. The
//!   verdict vocabulary is `valid`/`incomplete`/`not_run`, and none of the
//!   three is a support-tier, repair-correctness, gate, badge, or promotion
//!   claim.
//! - Ordinary CI validates accepted metadata offline: no repository
//!   materialization, no RIPR execution, no external commands, and no
//!   filesystem lookups beyond the supplied artifact files themselves (an
//!   external authority's bytes are digested as recorded, never re-read).
//!
//! Parser discipline follows the repo validator canon (`eval_sweep_check`):
//! strict JSON with duplicate-key rejection, deny-unknown-fields schemas,
//! present-null identity fields failing as garbage, checked arithmetic
//! everywhere, and fail-closed diagnostics naming subject/field/reason plus
//! the deterministic rerun command.
//!
//! Exit contract: `check` exits 0 when every present artifact is structurally
//! valid, disclosing absent optional selection identities (tree digest,
//! source currentness, limitation record) as `incomplete` and a missing
//! attempts dimension as `not_run`; it exits nonzero on any fail-closed
//! violation.
