//! Verdict for the advisory Windows lane (#2393).
//!
//! The lane runs `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast` twice and hands both
//! logs plus both captured exit statuses here.
//!
//! # Absence is not a pass
//!
//! The load-bearing rule is that a test missing from a log has **not** been
//! observed passing. `cargo test` can stop before later binaries, a run can die
//! mid-way, and a filter can exclude a name — so "failed in run 1, absent in
//! run 2" cannot be read as "passed in run 2, therefore flaky". Each test gets a
//! three-state observation per run ([`TestObservation`]) and the verdict is
//! derived from the pair, with an explicit `masked_unknown` outcome when one side
//! never observed the test at all.
//!
//! Verdicts are deliberately named for what two samples establish:
//! `repeated_failure` (reproduced in both samples) rather than "deterministic
//! defect", because a shared race can reproduce twice.
//!
//! # Missing evidence is a failure, not a pass
//!
//! Test failures are advisory: the lane does not gate merges on them. Failure to
//! *produce trustworthy evidence* is different, and this command exits non-zero
//! for it — a missing log, a missing exit status, an unreadable file, or a zero
//! exit status over a log that does not show a test run ([`RunState::
//! IncompleteEvidence`]). A lane that reported success while its own evidence was
//! absent would be the exact false-confidence condition it exists to prevent,
//! and a `0` in a status file is not on its own evidence that anything ran.
//!
//! # Release-seam controls must be observed
//!
//! A handful of tests are the only native Windows proof for a release seam
//! (#3922): Job Object process ownership, poisoned LSP initialize terminality,
//! and the stat-only cache refusal. Their names are listed in
//! [`RELEASE_SEAM_CONTROLS`] and every run reports each one's observation. A
//! control that *fails* stays advisory like any other test. A control that is
//! *absent* from a usable run is an evidence failure: the seam would otherwise
//! read as covered by a green lane that never executed its only native proof.
