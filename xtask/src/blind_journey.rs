//! Blind-journey contract and validator (#4603, RIPR-SPEC-0198).
//!
//! Typed, versioned DTOs for an auditable blind installed-agent journey:
//! `BlindJourneyPromptV1`, `BlindJourneyAnswerKeyV1`, `BlindJourneyEventV1`,
//! `BlindJourneyInterventionV1` and `BlindJourneyReceiptV1`, plus the offline
//! validator that decides whether one packet is an internally consistent,
//! audit-complete transcript. Candidate/process/artifact admission stays with
//! the #4510 harness; this contract references those identities and validates
//! the operator-visible transcript rather than copying admission authority.
//!
//! Two contamination judgments stay mechanically distinct: a closed,
//! structured mechanical scan over the exact prompt bytes rejects evaluator
//! only fields, internal references and preselected item/target/command/artifact
//! hints, and a retained named-reviewer verdict over the exact prompt and the
//! separately stored answer key addresses semantic answer leakage. A reviewer
//! label never overrides a mechanical finding, and a missing or non-accepted
//! review refuses a positive blind result.
//!
//! The validator runs no candidate, launches no process and decides no release
//! verdict; synthetic validator success claims only that one committed packet
//! is an auditable transcript under this contract.
