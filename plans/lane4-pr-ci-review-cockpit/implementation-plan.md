# Lane 4 PR / CI Review Cockpit Implementation Plan

Status: complete

Lane: 4

Linked lane tracker:
[docs/lanes/LANE_4_PR_CI_REVIEW.md](../../docs/lanes/LANE_4_PR_CI_REVIEW.md)

Existing behavior specs:
[RIPR-SPEC-0023](../../docs/specs/RIPR-SPEC-0023-pr-review-front-panel-report.md)
and
[RIPR-SPEC-0024](../../docs/specs/RIPR-SPEC-0024-report-packet-index.md).

Planned proposal path:
`docs/proposals/RIPR-PROP-0004-pr-ci-review-cockpit.md`.

Planned generated-CI workflow spec path:
`docs/specs/RIPR-SPEC-0038-generated-pr-ci-review-workflow.md`.
This checkout already uses `RIPR-SPEC-0032` through `RIPR-SPEC-0038`.

Generated-CI gap map:
[generated-ci-gap-map.md](generated-ci-gap-map.md).

Generated-CI baseline audit:
[generated-ci-baseline-audit.md](generated-ci-baseline-audit.md).

## Objective

Turn explicit RIPR PR-time artifacts into a reviewer-first, agent-usable,
advisory PR/CI cockpit: front panel, packet index, generated summary, repair
commands, receipts, language grouping when configured, and clear gate authority
boundaries.

Lane 4 composes explicit artifacts. It must not change analyzer behavior,
mutation execution, source editing, generated tests, editor behavior, policy
semantics, branch protection, or default CI blocking.

## End State

- PR review front panel renders from explicit artifacts only.
- Report packet index groups uploaded artifacts by reviewer use.
- Generated GitHub job summary starts with reviewer-readable next action.
- Missing expected artifacts include regeneration commands.
- Gate decision remains the only configured pass/fail authority.
- Language-aware grouping appears only when `[languages]` declares more than
  Rust.
- Rust-default generated CI output remains unchanged.
- Dogfood receipts cover complete, sparse, blocked, missing-proof,
  unchanged-after-attempt, improved, and preview-language packets.

## Current Baseline

This plan starts from current `main`. It is not a replay of the original
Campaign 24 and Campaign 25 implementation ladders.

Already shipped Lane 4 surfaces:

| Surface | Current evidence |
| --- | --- |
| PR review front panel | [RIPR-SPEC-0023](../../docs/specs/RIPR-SPEC-0023-pr-review-front-panel-report.md), [PR review front panel workflow](../../docs/PR_REVIEW_FRONT_PANEL_WORKFLOW.md), `ripr pr-review front-panel`, generated CI projection, fixture corpus, capability entry, and [Campaign 24 closeout](../../docs/handoffs/2026-05-10-campaign-24-closeout.md) |
| Report packet index | [RIPR-SPEC-0024](../../docs/specs/RIPR-SPEC-0024-report-packet-index.md), [Report packet index workflow](../../docs/REPORT_PACKET_INDEX_WORKFLOW.md), `ripr reports index`, generated CI projection, fixture corpus, dogfood receipts, capability entry, and [Campaign 25 closeout](../../docs/handoffs/2026-05-10-campaign-25-closeout.md) |
| Generated CI wiring for those surfaces | `crates/ripr/src/cli/commands.rs` emits the generated workflow steps, uploads the artifacts, and appends advisory summaries while preserving gate-decision authority |

Future Lane 4 work must audit, compose, document, extend, or close gaps in
those shipped surfaces. It must not create duplicate front-panel or packet-index
producers unless a later spec intentionally changes their public contracts.

## Work Items

### 1. `docs/lane4-source-of-truth`

Goal:
Define the Lane 4 source-of-truth model and PR/CI review cockpit boundaries.

Production delta:
Add `docs/lanes/LANE_4_PR_CI_REVIEW.md`,
`plans/lane4-pr-ci-review-cockpit/README.md`, and this implementation plan.

Non-goals:
No generated CI, report producer, schema, fixture, analyzer, editor, gate,
policy, source-edit, generated-test, provider, or mutation-execution changes.

Acceptance:
The new docs explain what Lane 4 owns, what it consumes, what it does not own,
how proposal/spec/ADR/plan/manifest/policy/handoff artifacts differ, and what
validation gates apply.

Proof commands:

```bash
rtk cargo xtask check-doc-index
rtk cargo xtask markdown-links
rtk cargo xtask check-static-language
rtk cargo xtask check-doc-roles
rtk cargo xtask check-pr
rtk git diff --check
```

Rollback:
Remove the Lane 4 tracker and plan files plus any index links added for this
slice.

### 2. `docs/lane4-proposal`

Goal:
Add the Lane 4 PR/CI review cockpit proposal.

Production delta:
Add `docs/proposals/RIPR-PROP-0004-pr-ci-review-cockpit.md`.

Non-goals:
No behavior contract edits beyond links to existing and planned specs. No
implementation or generated workflow changes.

Acceptance:
The proposal states the review-compression problem, users and surfaces,
success criteria, alternatives considered, feedback loop, specs to create or
update, non-goals, risks, evidence plan, and exit criteria.

Proof commands:

```bash
rtk cargo xtask check-doc-roles
rtk cargo xtask check-doc-index
rtk cargo xtask markdown-links
rtk cargo xtask check-static-language
rtk cargo xtask check-pr
rtk git diff --check
```

Rollback:
Remove the proposal and any index links added for it.

### 3. `docs/lane4-spec-role-alignment`

Goal:
Make the existing front-panel and packet-index specs explicit about their role.

Production delta:
Update RIPR-SPEC-0023 and RIPR-SPEC-0024 with role front-matter and a short
role section that says specs define behavior and acceptance, while this plan
defines PR order.

Non-goals:
No heavy rewrite, schema change, producer change, fixture change, or generated
CI change.

Acceptance:
Both specs retain their behavior contracts and clearly link to the proposal and
plan role boundaries without changing current acceptance semantics.

Proof commands:

```bash
rtk cargo xtask check-spec-format
rtk cargo xtask check-doc-index
rtk cargo xtask markdown-links
rtk cargo xtask check-static-language
rtk cargo xtask check-pr
rtk git diff --check
```

Rollback:
Revert the role front-matter and role-section additions.

### 4. `docs/generated-pr-ci-review-workflow-spec`

Goal:
Define the generated PR CI review workflow contract.

Production delta:
Add `docs/specs/RIPR-SPEC-0038-generated-pr-ci-review-workflow.md`.

Non-goals:
No workflow implementation, branch-protection change, default blocking change,
hidden analysis rerun, inline comment publishing, source edit, generated test,
or gate semantic change.

Acceptance:
The spec defines generated workflow sections, public command surfaces, artifact
upload contract, job summary contract, advisory/default behavior, gate
authority boundaries, language-aware grouping rules, retry or regeneration
commands, and branch-protection non-goals.

Proof commands:

```bash
rtk cargo xtask check-spec-format
rtk cargo xtask check-doc-index
rtk cargo xtask markdown-links
rtk cargo xtask check-static-language
rtk cargo xtask check-pr
rtk git diff --check
```

Rollback:
Remove the generated-CI spec and its spec-index entry.

### 5. `plans/report-packet-index`

Goal:
Add the report packet index implementation plan.

Production delta:
Add `plans/lane4-pr-ci-review-cockpit/report-packet-index.md`.

Non-goals:
No fixture, producer, generated CI, schema, or output change.

Acceptance:
The plan sequences fixture corpus, public `ripr reports index` command,
JSON/Markdown renderer, generated CI integration, dogfood receipt, and closeout
with goal, production delta, non-goals, acceptance, proof commands, and
rollback for each slice.

Proof commands:

```bash
rtk cargo xtask markdown-links
rtk cargo xtask check-static-language
rtk cargo xtask check-doc-roles
rtk cargo xtask check-pr
rtk git diff --check
```

Rollback:
Remove the report-packet-index plan file.

### 6. `plans/pr-review-front-panel`

Goal:
Add the PR review front panel implementation plan.

Production delta:
Add `plans/lane4-pr-ci-review-cockpit/pr-review-front-panel.md`.

Non-goals:
No fixture, producer, generated CI, schema, or output change.

Acceptance:
The plan sequences explicit artifact input corpus, input status reader,
front-panel selection and fallback states, JSON/Markdown renderer, generated CI
summary projection, and dogfood receipts with goal, production delta,
non-goals, acceptance, proof commands, and rollback for each slice.

Proof commands:

```bash
rtk cargo xtask markdown-links
rtk cargo xtask check-static-language
rtk cargo xtask check-doc-roles
rtk cargo xtask check-pr
rtk git diff --check
```

Rollback:
Remove the front-panel plan file.

### 7. `goals/lane4-active-manifest`

Goal:
Add a machine-readable Lane 4 manifest without replacing the active Campaign
27 manifest unless Lane 4 becomes the active executor.

Production delta:
Add `.ripr/goals/lanes/lane4-pr-ci-review-cockpit.toml` or another manifest
path supported by the current goals tooling.

Non-goals:
No overwrite of `.ripr/goals/active.toml` while Campaign 27 remains active. No
new goals command behavior unless explicitly selected.

Acceptance:
The manifest includes id, title, status, lane, objective, end_state, work_item
entries, dependencies, stackability where needed, and proof commands.

Proof commands:

```bash
rtk cargo xtask check-campaign
rtk cargo xtask goals status
rtk cargo xtask check-static-language
rtk cargo xtask check-pr
rtk git diff --check
```

Rollback:
Remove the Lane 4 manifest or restore the previous manifest pointer.

### 8. `xtask/check-doc-roles-lane4`

Goal:
Encode the source-of-truth role method into advisory validation.

Production delta:
Extend `cargo xtask check-doc-roles` to cover proposal, spec, ADR, plan, and
goal-manifest role requirements.

Non-goals:
Do not make the check blocking beyond current `check-pr` policy until one
release cycle shows low noise. Do not rewrite old handoffs or plans in this
slice.

Acceptance:
The checker reports missing required role sections and writes a repair-oriented
policy report without changing docs automatically.

Proof commands:

```bash
rtk cargo test -p xtask doc_roles
rtk cargo xtask check-doc-roles
rtk cargo xtask check-pr
rtk git diff --check
```

Rollback:
Revert the checker extension and keep current proposal/ADR-only validation.

### 9. `audit/pr-review-front-panel-current-state`

Goal:
Record the current PR review front-panel state as a shipped dependency for
future Lane 4 cockpit work.

Production delta:
Update planning, tracker, or closeout docs only if the current shipped
front-panel evidence is stale or hard for agents to discover.

Non-goals:
No duplicate fixture corpus, producer, command, renderer, generated CI step,
schema, or output-contract change. No analyzer, editor, gate, source-edit,
generated-test, provider, or mutation-execution change.

Acceptance:
The Lane 4 plan names the front-panel producer, fixture corpus, generated CI
projection, capability entry, and closeout as current baseline evidence rather
than future TODO work.

Proof commands:

```bash
rtk cargo test -p ripr pr_review_front_panel
rtk cargo xtask check-fixture-contracts
rtk cargo xtask check-output-contracts
rtk cargo xtask check-static-language
rtk cargo xtask check-pr
rtk git diff --check
```

Rollback:
Revert only the audit or planning-doc updates.

### 10. `audit/report-packet-index-current-state`

Goal:
Record the current report packet index state as a shipped dependency for future
Lane 4 cockpit work.

Production delta:
Update planning, tracker, or closeout docs only if the current shipped
packet-index evidence is stale or hard for agents to discover.

Non-goals:
No duplicate fixture corpus, producer, command, renderer, generated CI step,
schema, or output-contract change. No analyzer, editor, gate, source-edit,
generated-test, provider, or mutation-execution change.

Acceptance:
The Lane 4 plan names the packet-index producer, fixture corpus, generated CI
projection, dogfood receipts, capability entry, and closeout as current
baseline evidence rather than future TODO work.

Proof commands:

```bash
rtk cargo test -p ripr report_packet_index
rtk cargo xtask check-fixture-contracts
rtk cargo xtask check-output-contracts
rtk cargo xtask check-pr
rtk git diff --check
```

Rollback:
Revert only the audit or planning-doc updates.

### 11. `docs/generated-ci-cockpit-gap-map`

Goal:
Map the remaining generated-CI cockpit gaps after the shipped front panel and
packet index.

Production delta:
Add [generated-ci-gap-map.md](generated-ci-gap-map.md) to show how the current
generated workflow composes front panel, packet index, policy artifacts,
receipts, and language grouping, and which remaining behavior belongs in later
generated-CI work.

Non-goals:
No generated workflow implementation change, default blocking change, branch
protection change, inline comment publishing, hidden analysis rerun, source
edit, generated test, provider call, or mutation execution.

Acceptance:
The gap map makes current shipped workflow behavior clear enough that a later
generated-CI spec can define only missing or changed behavior, not duplicate
front-panel or packet-index implementation.

Proof commands:

```bash
rtk cargo xtask check-doc-index
rtk cargo xtask markdown-links
rtk cargo xtask check-static-language
rtk cargo xtask check-pr
rtk git diff --check
```

Rollback:
Remove the generated-CI gap-map doc or revert the related doc updates.

### 12. `audit/generated-ci-cockpit-baseline`

Goal:
Record the current generated CI cockpit baseline.

Production delta:
Add [generated-ci-baseline-audit.md](generated-ci-baseline-audit.md) with the
current public command surface, generated workflow envelope, report commands,
front-panel and packet-index placement, job-summary sections, artifact upload
paths, missing-artifact behavior, gate authority boundary, inline-comment
boundary, and language-grouping status.

Non-goals:
No generated workflow implementation change, default blocking change, branch
protection change, inline comment publishing, hidden analysis rerun, source
edit, generated test, provider call, mutation execution, analyzer change,
editor change, or gate semantic change.

Acceptance:
The audit gives the next generated-summary or dogfood PR a durable baseline and
records remaining gaps without duplicating the front-panel or packet-index
producers.

Proof commands:

```bash
rtk cargo xtask check-doc-index
rtk cargo xtask markdown-links
rtk cargo xtask check-static-language
rtk cargo xtask check-campaign
rtk cargo xtask check-pr
rtk git diff --check
```

Rollback:
Remove the baseline audit and any related planning links.

### 13. `ci/generated-summary-cockpit-contract`

Goal:
Align generated summary output with the cockpit contract.

Production delta:
Update the generated GitHub workflow summary so the reviewer sees a
`Start here` section before the detailed cockpit sections, and so known
missing-cockpit surfaces include regeneration commands for first useful action,
the PR review front panel, and the report packet index.

Non-goals:
No language-aware grouping, default blocking change, branch-protection change,
inline comment publishing change, analyzer change, editor change, gate
semantic change, generated-workflow source edit behavior, generated test,
provider call, or mutation execution.

Acceptance:
Generated CI remains advisory by default, Rust-default behavior stays
compatible, gate authority remains with `ripr gate evaluate`, and focused tests
pin the `Start here` and regeneration-command strings in the generated
workflow.

Proof commands:

```bash
rtk cargo test -p ripr init_generated_github_workflow
rtk cargo xtask check-workflows
rtk cargo xtask check-static-language
rtk cargo xtask check-pr
rtk git diff --check
```

Rollback:
Revert the generated workflow summary strings and the focused workflow tests.

### 14. `ci/language-aware-grouping`

Goal:
Group PR advisory output by language when preview adapters are configured.

Production delta:
Generated CI groups advisory findings by language only when `[languages]`
declares more than Rust.

Non-goals:
Do not start this slice until the preview adapters provide enough Python and
TypeScript evidence. No Rust-default behavior change. No gate authority change.

Acceptance:
`[languages] = ["rust"]` remains byte-for-byte or behavior-equivalent to the
current generated CI summary, while configured preview languages are visibly
labeled preview/advisory.

Proof commands:

```bash
rtk cargo test -p ripr language_aware
rtk cargo xtask fixtures
rtk cargo xtask goldens check
rtk cargo xtask check-workflows
rtk cargo xtask check-pr
rtk git diff --check
```

Rollback:
Remove language grouping from generated summaries and retain Rust-default
summary behavior.

### 15. `dogfood/lane4-cockpit-gap-receipts`

Goal:
Add PR/CI review cockpit dogfood receipts for generated-CI summary behavior not
already covered by Campaign 24 and Campaign 25.

Production delta:
Extend `cargo xtask dogfood` with a generated-CI cockpit receipt that renders
`ripr init --ci github --dry-run` and checks the `Start here` summary,
regeneration commands, artifact upload, advisory default, and gate-authority
boundary.

Non-goals:
Do not duplicate existing front-panel or packet-index dogfood cases. No new
report semantics. No analyzer, gate, editor, source-edit, generated-test,
provider, mutation, or default-blocking changes.

Acceptance:
`cargo xtask dogfood` writes checked receipts for the generated workflow
cockpit case and links back to existing Campaign 24 and Campaign 25 receipts
for covered front-panel and packet-index states.

Proof commands:

```bash
rtk cargo test -p xtask dogfood_
rtk cargo xtask dogfood
rtk cargo xtask check-output-contracts
rtk cargo xtask check-capabilities
rtk cargo xtask check-pr
rtk git diff --check
```

Rollback:
Remove only the newly added gap receipts and dogfood wiring.

### 16. `docs/lane4-closeout`

Goal:
Close the PR/CI review cockpit lane with durable proof and restart context.

Production delta:
Add `docs/handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD-lane4-pr-ci-review-cockpit-closeout.md` and
update capability, roadmap, implementation, and lane status surfaces as needed.

Non-goals:
No new behavior in the closeout PR. Do not reopen analyzer, editor, gate,
policy, generated workflow, or preview-language work.

Acceptance:
The closeout states what shipped, what did not change, validation commands,
deferred language-aware grouping, known limits, and next-lane handoff.

Proof commands:

```bash
rtk cargo xtask check-doc-index
rtk cargo xtask markdown-links
rtk cargo xtask check-static-language
rtk cargo xtask check-campaign
rtk cargo xtask check-capabilities
rtk cargo xtask check-traceability
rtk cargo xtask check-pr
rtk git diff --check
```

Rollback:
Remove the closeout and restore the previous lane/capability status.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and write a blocked report instead of broadening the PR if a slice would
require:

- changing analyzer evidence semantics;
- adding or changing public output schemas outside the selected spec;
- changing policy or gate authority;
- changing branch protection or default CI blocking;
- adding dependencies;
- publishing inline PR comments outside the explicit inline-comment lane;
- changing editor or LSP behavior;
- changing release, package, or publish behavior;
- creating source edits or generated tests;
- running provider calls or mutation execution.
