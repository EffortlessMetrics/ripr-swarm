//! Name-admitted dependent-package scope for Draft/Fast diff indexing (#5320).
//!
//! With unchanged tests, Draft/Fast selection indexes the changed packages
//! plus every package that reaches them through path dependencies (#2970
//! slice C). On a large workspace that reverse closure is most of the
//! repository: a two-file change in `bevy_reflect` selected 1,738 of 1,925
//! files and tripped the `diff_scope_oversized` guard. By default the
//! narrowing below runs only when that closure would exceed the index limit
//! (see [`DependentScopeMode::Auto`]).
//!
//! The extra packages cannot contribute related tests here. The selection
//! is never workspace-complete, so the related-test package guard drops
//! every cross-package test that is not reached through the owner-uniqueness
//! or dependency-edge admits, and both of those admits require a
//! workspace-complete index. What a dependent file can still change is a
//! whole-index scan:
//!
//! - name-keyed scans of the changed owner: the "may be reached unseen" and
//!   non-test-caller scans, same-named definitions (receiver identity,
//!   competing definitions), receiver type declarations, `impl <trait> for`
//!   receivers and the one-inherent-constructor count;
//! - a caller chain to the owner (the transitive and macro reach witnesses);
//! - a Cargo binary invocation (the subprocess reach limitation);
//! - module composition through `#[path]` and `include!` (file roles);
//! - a package nested under a changed one, which passes the package guard;
//! - a registered test-harness target;
//! - macro bindings that make `assert_eq!` and local empty macros ambiguous
//!   for the owner pin, unioned over every indexed file.
//!
//! [`AdmissionQuery`] evaluates the name-keyed scans over the changed
//! packages' own index first. Each is monotone in the files it sees, so a
//! scan those packages already decide needs no dependent file; only the
//! names left open become admission tests. Nested packages, harness targets
//! and composition or subprocess markers are admitted outright. The macro
//! bindings of withheld files are folded into the owner-pin unions without
//! indexing them. The witness walks run only for `no_static_path` findings;
//! [`NarrowedScope::reach_index`] widens to the owner's caller levels on
//! demand, bounded by the walks' own depth, and names an unsearched reach
//! when that widening would exceed the index limit.
//!
//! Every admission test is a lexical superset of the parser fact it stands
//! for: a call, definition or mention the index records is spelled in the
//! file's bytes. Two cases keep the full selection instead: a changed probe
//! file with no derivable package prefix (the related-test package guard does
//! not apply to it, so any indexed test may relate), and a selection that
//! already spans the workspace (narrowing would turn off the
//! workspace-complete admits).
