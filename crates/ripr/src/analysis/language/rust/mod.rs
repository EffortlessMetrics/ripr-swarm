//! Reference adapter for Rust.
//!
//! See `docs/specs/RIPR-SPEC-0026-language-adapter-contract.md`.
//!
//! `mod.rs` is the stable `analysis::language::rust` façade. Probe-family
//! lexical extraction lives in [`probes`]; Rust-local oracle/assertion
//! limitations live in [`oracles`]. Index, repository, and diff-pipeline
//! extraction remain here until later RA slices. Call sites keep the
//! `analysis::language::rust` path.
//!
//! This adapter hosts the existing Rust analysis pipeline behind the
//! `LanguageAdapter` seam. The bodies of `analyze_diff` and `analyze_repo`
//! are relocated from `analysis::pipeline` without behavior change; the
//! pipeline module is now a language-neutral orchestrator that loads the
//! diff, dispatches to this adapter, and applies sort + summary on the
//! returned findings.
