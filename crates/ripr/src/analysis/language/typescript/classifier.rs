///
/// This is the RIPR-SPEC-0098 observation guard, scoped to **effect families**
/// (SideEffect and CallDeletion) where the false-exposed pattern is clearest:
/// a call side-effect (e.g. `console.log("audit", amount*9)`) was being promoted
/// to Exposed by value-based `toBe`/`toEqual` assertions in the same test body
/// that assert the owner's UNCHANGED return value.
///
/// ### What the guard checks
///
/// The confirmation decision keys on **`oracle_kind`** — which the live oracle
/// extractor always populates (`oracle.rs`) — rather than relying on
/// `observed_expression`, which is optional metadata. For SideEffect /
/// CallDeletion families a strong assertion CONFIRMS (returns `true`,
/// stays Exposed) only when it actually witnesses a call effect:
/// 1. It is an effect-shape oracle
///    (`MockExpectation` | `Snapshot` | `WholeObjectEquality`) — these capture
///    mock-call expectations, serialized snapshots, or persisted whole-object
///    state, all of which observe side effects directly; OR
/// 2. It carries an `observed_expression` that either shares an exact changed
///    identifier token (> 3 chars, dot/path-adjacent segments excluded, same
///    `identifier_tokens` rules on both sides) or names a side-channel (an
///    expression that does NOT name the owner — e.g. a closure-local
///    side-effect variable or a captured mock).
///
/// Value-shaped strong oracles (`ExactValue` / `ExactErrorVariant`) that observe
/// the owner's RETURN VALUE do NOT witness a `console.log`/side-effect change, so
/// they do not confirm. When the only strong oracles are value-shaped (or no
/// observed-expression metadata is available to prove a side-channel), the guard
/// **fails closed** and returns `false`, downgrading to WeaklyExposed.
///
/// ### Value families (ReturnValue / FieldConstruction)
///
/// A strong assertion confirms (returns `true`, stays Exposed) only when it
/// actually observes the changed sink:
/// 1. Its `oracle_kind` matches the seam family (the same filter
///    `strongest_family_matching_oracle` applies); AND
/// 2. Its `observed_expression` either references the owner (the owner name or
///    an owner call, e.g. `expect(applyDiscount(100, 10))`) or contains a
///    changed token from the changed sub-expression.
///
/// One-hop local aliasing: a bare-local observed_expression
/// (`t.is(result, 3)`) also confirms when the test body initializes that
/// local from an expression referencing the owner or a changed token
/// (`const result = add(1, 2)`). Without this credit the guard would
/// falsely downgrade the canonical assert-the-return-value pattern and emit
/// repair packets for tests that already observe the changed sink — the
/// exact over-correction the RIPR-SPEC-0108 `must_stay_exposed` corpus
/// controls (`ts_ava_t_is_exact_value`, `ts_tape_equal_exact_value`) pin.
///
/// An assertion on an UNRELATED expression (`expect(formatDate(now))`, or a
/// local initialized from an unrelated call) does not witness
/// `return amount - 12;`: the changed value never escapes into the observed
/// expression, so the guard fails closed and the finding downgrades to
/// WeaklyExposed. This mirrors the sink-alignment evidence the Python
/// adapter already surfaces.
///
/// For all other families the guard always returns `true` (pre-guard
/// behaviour). SideEffect / CallDeletion behaviour is pinned and unchanged.
///
/// ### Fail-closed default (RIPR-SPEC-0098 hardening, #1235)
///
/// Earlier revisions returned `true` ("confirmed") when no strong assertion
/// carried `observed_expression` metadata. That was a fail-OPEN fallback:
/// "can't tell what's observed → assume observed → exposed", which is exactly the
/// over-claim this guard exists to kill. It is removed. The decision now keys on
/// `oracle_kind` (always populated live) plus an optional `observed_expression`
/// token / side-channel check; absence of `observed_expression` no longer
/// re-promotes a swallowed side effect to Exposed.

///
/// A strong exact assertion somewhere in a related test does not show that the
/// changed comparison is discriminated: `shippingFee(60)` and `shippingFee(10)`
/// both behave identically under `total > 50` and `total >= 50`. Only an input
/// at the boundary (`total == 50`) tells the two apart, so `Exposed` requires
/// an assertion whose observed owner call carries that boundary:
///
/// - **One literal operand** (`total >= 50`, `status === 'paid'`): an argument
///   of the observed owner call carries the literal at a position the
///   comparison reads, standing alone as a value (#4102 guards 1 and 2) —
///   either the whole argument is the literal, or an object-literal argument
///   pins the comparison operand's field to it (`{ total: 50 }`). A literal
///   inside a larger expression (`price + 100`) leaves the effective input
///   unknown and never witnesses. With owner parameter facts, an argument at
///   or beyond the declared arity is dead (`applyDiscount(150, 100)` against
///   a single-parameter owner never reads `100`), and when the compared
///   operand names an owner parameter the literal must sit in exactly that
///   parameter's position; without parameter facts (destructured or rest
///   signatures) the position check degrades to arity-blind matching rather
///   than guessing.
/// - **Expected side liveness** (#4102 guard 5): a dynamically resolved
///   expectation (`toBe(applyDiscount(100))`) and a self-comparing tautology
///   cannot discriminate. When the owner body is available, a dead expected
///   literal — one that matches neither the changed behavior's value at the
///   boundary input nor, when checkable, differs from the unchanged
///   behavior's — cannot witness either; unresolved checks leave the witness
///   decision unchanged rather than fabricate runtime facts.
/// - **No literal operand** (`count <= limit`): the adapter has no literal to
///   map, so it accepts the same textual witness the Rust boundary evidence
///   accepts without value resolution — two identical LIVE arguments in one
///   observed owner call (`isAllowed(5, 5)`) — or an object-literal argument
///   that names both operands with identical values (`PriceLabel({ amount:
///   100, threshold: 100 })`). Otherwise the boundary is not witnessed.
/// - **No parseable comparison** (`if (Number.isNaN(n))`, `case 'gold':`) or an
///   ambiguous fallback shape (`}`): nothing statically ties a test to the
///   changed branch, so this fails closed.

// ── Family↔oracle-kind matching (RIPR-SPEC-0104) ─────────────────────────────

/// Returns `true` when `oracle_kind` can observe the seam identified by
/// `probe_family`.
///
/// This is the single source of truth for the TS-adapter assertion-level
/// family↔kind filter. It mirrors `oracle_kind_matches_seam_kind` from
/// `test_grip_evidence.rs` (which operates on Rust `SeamKind`), adapted for
/// the TypeScript `ProbeFamily` vocabulary.
///
/// ### Mapping table (RIPR-SPEC-0104 §3)
///
/// | ProbeFamily | Excluded OracleKinds (Strong-rank only — the honesty fix) |
/// |---|---|
/// | `ErrorPath` | `ExactValue`, `RelationalCheck`, `MockExpectation` |
/// | `ReturnValue`, `Predicate`, `FieldConstruction`, `MatchArm` | `ExactErrorVariant`, `BroadError`, `MockExpectation` |
/// | `SideEffect`, `CallDeletion` | *(handled by RIPR-SPEC-0098 observation guard — no additional exclusion here)* |
/// | `StaticUnknown` | *(fail-open — all oracles admitted)* |
///
/// ### Design: fail-closed only at the cross-domain seam boundary
///
/// The HONESTY BUG addressed by this function is specifically the case where a
/// **Strong wrong-domain** oracle is credited to a seam whose family it cannot
/// observe:
///
/// - An `ExactErrorVariant` oracle (`.toThrow(DiscountError)`) is an error-path
///   discriminator. It MUST NOT count as a strong match for a `ReturnValue` or
///   `Predicate` seam — these seams emit a value, not an error.
/// - An `ExactValue` oracle (`.toBe(90)`) is a value discriminator. It MUST NOT
///   count as a strong match for an `ErrorPath` seam — the seam throws, not returns.
///
/// ### Composing with RIPR-SPEC-0098 (SideEffect observation guard)
///
/// For `SideEffect` and `CallDeletion` families, RIPR-SPEC-0098 already provides
/// a dedicated observation guard (`ts_changed_value_is_observed`) that correctly
/// handles the case where a value-shaped `ExactValue` assertion observes the owner
/// RETURN value (not the call effect). That guard fires in the
/// `else if strongest_strength >= Strong.rank()` arm of the classifier.
/// To preserve that path, `ExactValue` is NOT excluded from `SideEffect` /
/// `CallDeletion` by this function — SPEC-0098 handles those seams independently.
/// The two specs compose: SPEC-0104 handles cross-domain value↔error exclusion;
/// SPEC-0098 handles the same-domain but wrong-target SideEffect case.
///
/// ### Weak oracle kinds are always admitted
///
/// `SmokeOnly`, `Unknown`, `BroadError` (for non-error families),
/// `RelationalCheck` (for non-error families) are admitted for all concrete
/// families because they are weak/absent and do NOT contradict any family.
/// Their rank (Smoke / Unknown / Weak) prevents them from triggering
/// `Exposed` promotion regardless. Admitting them preserves accurate
/// per-kind messaging in `weak_oracle_missing_summary`.
