//! Native Python repo-mode evidence producer (#3554 PR B) and its public
//! Finding projection (#3554 PR C).
//!
//! [`build_repo_evidence`] builds facts ONCE over the selected working set
//! (`PythonRepoInput`, PR A) and produces native Python behavior items with
//! related-test/oracle evidence and typed limitations. It reuses the same
//! producer-owned authorities as diff mode and never re-derives Python
//! semantics:
//!
//! - `extract_source_facts`: the single read+parse per file, yielding
//!   owners, tests, and per-statement source facts;
//! - `owner_for_changed_line`: the shared line-to-owner mapping;
//! - `classify_probe_shape`: the native `ProbeFamily`/`DeltaKind`;
//! - `canonical_python_gap_for`: the same canonical gap identity rules as
//!   diff mode;
//! - `related_test_candidates` / `find_related_tests`: the shared matcher
//!   (exact/import/call/helper evidence, uncertain name-similarity links);
//! - `classify_sink_alignment_with_old`: the sink-alignment read-out;
//! - `static_limit_for_change`: typed dynamic-resolution and
//!   unsupported-syntax limits.
//!
//! Boundaries held by this producer:
//!
//! - no Rust projection and no `SeamKind` bridge (#3039/#1937): items carry
//!   the native `ProbeFamily`, exact owner identity, discriminator,
//!   relation, oracle kind/strength, and limitations separately;
//! - production behavior items come only from `production_files`; test and
//!   helper files enter the evidence (test) pool only and never seed
//!   production findings (#3554);
//! - conservative vocabulary only: statuses and limits describe what the
//!   run covered; the mutation-outcome vocabulary is never used here (see
//!   the workspace language rules);
//! - deterministic: iteration follows the sorted selected inputs and parse
//!   order, with no timestamps, so identical input yields identical
//!   evidence (pinned by a byte/digest test below).
//!
//! PR C projection: the same pass also emits the public `Finding`s
//! ([`PythonRepoEvidence::findings`]) by running the diff-mode classifier
//! (`classify_change_with_context`) over each representative behavior line,
//! so repo-mode findings are indistinguishable in shape from diff-mode
//! findings and retain native Python identity. [`partial_disclosure`]
//! renders the typed partial/capped run state for the pipeline's shared
//! `LanguageRun` channel; `analyze_repo` (PR C) is the production caller.
//!
//! Parse timeouts are NOT typed here: the parser substrate
//! (`rustpython_parser::parse`) exposes no per-file timeout mechanism, and
//! a fabricated timeout row would be invented evidence. The deferral is
//! recorded in this doc comment until a real producer condition exists
//! (#3554 PR B); read and parse failures are typed as
//! [`PythonRepoLimitation::ParseFailure`] rows today.
