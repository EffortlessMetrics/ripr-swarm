//! Bounded fail-closed reachability authority for libtest-mimic trial
//! subjects (#3636).
//!
//! #3635 named the dead-construction over-credit: every statically
//! collected `Trial::test("name", cb)` in a registered target entered the
//! executable-test denominator, including constructors in unused helpers
//! or collections never passed to the harness's run entry point. This
//! authority answers one bounded question per trial: can the trial's
//! construction reach the registered run entry point's trial argument
//! through the resolution forms a token scanner can establish?
//!
//! ## Anchor
//!
//! The run entry point is the exact registered marker path spelled
//! qualified (`<marker>::run`) or a bare `run` bound by a top-level
//! `use` from the marker — the same import-resolution machinery the
//! trial scanner itself uses. A bare `run` with conflicting imports
//! never anchors (fail closed). Method-position `x.run(...)` never
//! anchors, and calls inside dormant `macro_rules!` templates never
//! anchor.
//!
//! ## Supported resolution forms
//!
//! From the run call's second argument (the libtest-mimic trial
//! collection position), the resolver follows exactly:
//!
//! - direct trial-construction containment: every significant token of
//!   the (container-peeled) argument lies inside an anchored trial
//!   invocation span — `vec![Trial::test(..), ..]` and array literals,
//!   including trials collected inside other macros' token trees;
//! - `&`, `&mut`, `vec![..]`, `[..]`, and `local[..]` container
//!   peeling;
//! - immutable let-bound chains in the same function body, at block
//!   depth zero, bound before the run call, with a simple identifier
//!   pattern (`let trials = ..;`). A `mut` binding, a duplicate binding
//!   of one name, or a missing binding fails closed;
//! - one level of builder-function resolution: a bare-identifier call
//!   whose name resolves to exactly one top-level function under the
//!   same fail-closed gates the callback resolver uses
//!   ([`super::resolve_helper_function`]). Inside the builder body, the
//!   same containment and let-chain forms apply under a token
//!   accountancy: every significant token must lie inside a trial span,
//!   inside a parsed `let` statement, inside the `vec!`/array literal
//!   scaffolding, or be a trailing reference to a resolved binding.
//!   Builders called from builders are not resolved (one level is the
//!   contract).
//!
//! The hop budget is bounded ([`MAX_HOPS`]); exhausting it fails closed.
//!
//! ## Fail-closed map
//!
//! - a trial whose invocation is visible inside a resolved span is
//!   [`TrialReachability::Reachable`] — admitted, no disclosure;
//! - everything the resolver cannot connect or exclude is
//!   [`TrialReachability::Unknown`] — admitted (today's behavior) and
//!   disclosed by one aggregate typed limitation
//!   (`registration_reachability_unknown`) naming the trials. Unknown is
//!   the bias: a false unreachable silently drops a real subject, which
//!   is worse than a disclosed unknown;
//! - [`TrialReachability::Unreachable`] requires proof: either no
//!   supported run entry call exists in the target at all
//!   ([`UnreachableReason::RunEntryAbsent`]), or every anchored run
//!   argument resolved completely and the trial is not in the union
//!   ([`UnreachableReason::ExcludedByResolvedArguments`]). A target that
//!   calls an unsupported entry spelling (`run_tests`) — or anchors no
//!   run call while a bare `run` import conflicts — never concludes
//!   absence; the trials stay and are disclosed as unknown.
//!
//! Unreachable trials keep their subject fact and syntactic
//! `HarnessSubjectClaim::NamedInvocation` (a named invocation exists in
//! the registered target); their executable `TestFact` is withheld and a
//! per-trial `registration_unreachable` limitation names them. There is
//! no per-subject reachability field: the unknown bucket is exactly the
//! case where per-subject attribution is not reliable, so the disclosure
//! is aggregate and typed.
