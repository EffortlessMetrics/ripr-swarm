//! Repository-governed Rust test-harness registry (#3532).
//!
//! This module is the one authority that turns exact
//! `[analysis.test_harnesses]` registrations into typed source facts. It
//! runs once per index build, after the parameterized-test promotion and
//! the test-styles normalizer, so every downstream consumer (diff probes,
//! seam inventory, evidence relation, test selectors, projections) reads
//! the same derived facts.
//!
//! The authority model keeps the required distinctions apart:
//!
//! - a registered custom target is evidence-role, but NOT every function
//!   in it is an executable test — members carry
//!   [`FunctionSourceRole::HarnessHelper`] and only adapter-established
//!   subjects register `TestFact`s;
//! - a registered macro/attribute invocation is a test container, but
//!   RIPR did not expand every generated case — subjects state their
//!   [`HarnessSubjectClaim`];
//! - a known selector route ([`HarnessSelectorCapability::NamedUnexecuted`])
//!   is not a selector that ran — passive analysis never builds or
//!   executes a harness (the #3634 target validation reads `cargo
//!   metadata` for declarations only; it never compiles or runs tests);
//! - unregistered or ambiguous harnesses become typed limitations —
//!   never production reclassification and never executable-test
//!   optimism.
//!
//! Everything here is exact-match on configured inputs. There is no
//! inference from filenames, crate imports, macro suffixes, or function
//! names, and a registration that names a file outside the analyzed
//! index simply grants nothing (fail closed).
//!
//! ## Named-invocation evidence boundary (#3603)
//!
//! A trial subject's identity span is the registration invocation, but
//! the evidence it claims is widened in exactly two bounded directions,
//! both fail-closed:
//!
//! - a bare-identifier callback (`Trial::test("name", helper_fn)`) that
//!   resolves to exactly one function in the registered target file
//!   contributes that function's parsed body evidence (calls, oracles,
//!   literals) one level deep, with real line attribution; closures,
//!   path callbacks, and unresolved or ambiguous names contribute
//!   nothing beyond the invocation span;
//! - method-position `.unwrap()`/`.expect()` calls inside the claimed
//!   span register smoke oracles, the same evidence the ordinary
//!   `#[test]` parser records for `ast::MethodCallExpr`. Non-assertion
//!   macro input is skipped, matching what parsed method-call nodes
//!   could see.
//!
//! No strength over-credit is possible: helper evidence reuses the
//! ordinary parser path, and method oracles are smoke-strength by
//! construction.
//!
//! ## Named-invocation reachability boundary (#3604, #3636)
//!
//! [`HarnessSubjectClaim::NamedInvocation`] is a syntactic claim bounded
//! by the registered target: a named invocation exists in the registered
//! target. It is not a claim that the harness registers or executes the
//! trial. What the invocation contributes to the executable-test
//! denominator is decided by the bounded reachability authority
//! (`reachability.rs`, #3636), which anchors the registered run entry
//! point and resolves its trial argument through supported forms:
//!
//! - a construction provably excluded from every resolved run argument
//!   — or a target with no run entry call at all — keeps its subject
//!   fact and claim but does not enter the executable-test denominator;
//!   a per-trial `registration_unreachable` limitation names it;
//! - a construction the bounded resolver can neither connect nor
//!   exclude stays admitted (the #3604 posture) and is disclosed by one
//!   aggregate `registration_reachability_unknown` limitation naming
//!   the trials — unknown is the bias, because a false unreachable
//!   silently drops a real subject;
//! - admitted-but-unknown subjects still carry only the syntactic
//!   claim; there is no per-subject reachability field, because
//!   per-subject attribution is exactly what the unknown bucket cannot
//!   establish.
