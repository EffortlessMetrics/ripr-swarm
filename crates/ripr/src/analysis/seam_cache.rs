//! Fact-layer cache for repo seam analysis (`cache/repo-seam-facts-v1`).
//!
//! Caches `Vec<ClassifiedSeam>` keyed on the aggregate workspace state
//! (per-file content hashes, cfg/features, config, test intent,
//! suppressions, analyzer version, schema version). The cold path
//! computes the inventory from scratch and writes the entry; the warm
//! path returns the cached entry when the key matches; corrupt entries
//! degrade to `Miss` so analysis never fails because of cache state.
//!
//! Per Campaign 5A acceptance:
//!
//! - cache fact layers only — `FileFacts`, owner index, `RepoSeam` facts,
//!   `TestGripEvidence`, `ClassifiedSeam` summaries. v1 caches the
//!   workspace-level `Vec<ClassifiedSeam>` (which transitively covers
//!   the listed layers) and per-file `FileFacts` so timed-out cold paths can
//!   still make the next run cheaper.
//! - never cache rendered JSON, Markdown, diagnostics, hover, or packet
//!   strings. The renderers re-render from the cached facts.
//! - codec stays behind a module boundary
//!   ([`codec::encode`] / [`codec::decode`]).
//! - never `bincode`. v1 uses `serde_json` (inspectable, easy to debug).
//!   `postcard` is the binary path if profiling later proves it
//!   necessary; the codec module is the only place that needs to change.
//!
//! The cache directory lives at:
//!
//! ```text
//! {workspace_root}/target/ripr/cache/repo-seam-facts/{schema_version}/{key_hash}.json
//! ```
//!
//! A companion corpus fingerprint cache
//! (`repo-corpus-fingerprint/{schema_version}/{fingerprint}.json`, issue
//! #2108) maps a stat-only corpus signature — sorted `(path, mtime, size)`
//! tuples, plus the inode change time on unix — to the aggregate `files_content_hash` previously computed for
//! that signature, so a warm cache-key computation does not re-read the
//! corpus. A fingerprint miss costs nothing: the content hash is then
//! computed exactly as before and the mapping is stored.
//!
//! When `RIPR_CACHE_DIR` is set (non-empty), all cache writes and reads
//! use `{RIPR_CACHE_DIR}/...` as the cache base instead. When unset,
//! behaviour is unchanged — default `{workspace_root}/target/ripr/cache`.
//!
//! `{key_hash}` is the FNV-1a 64-bit hash of the canonical key fields,
//! so different keys land in different files and a v1 cache hit on a
//! v0.5 entry is impossible.
