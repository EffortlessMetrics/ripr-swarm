//! Cargo target enumeration for source-role confirmation (#3283).
//!
//! ripr never ran Cargo target discovery: `[[test]]` and `[[bench]]`
//! entries were invisible, so an explicit `path = "src/contract_test.rs"`
//! target could not confirm evidence role outside the default `tests/`
//! and `benches/` layouts. This module reads the package manifests that
//! own the analyzed files and extracts exactly the target declarations
//! the source-role model consumes.
//!
//! Bounded scope, stated so the gate does not overclaim:
//!
//! - Only explicit `path = ...` entries on `[[test]]` and `[[bench]]`
//!   targets are extracted. Autodiscovered targets live under `tests/`
//!   and `benches/` by construction, which the layout rules already
//!   classify.
//! - `autotests = false` / `autobenches = false` only suppress
//!   *autodiscovery*; explicit targets remain valid, so the flags are
//!   read but do not change classification.
//! - Malformed manifests never fail analysis: an unreadable or invalid
//!   `Cargo.toml` yields no declared targets for that package, and the
//!   layout rules keep applying (fail-closed toward production, which is
//!   the conservative direction — over-excluding production files is the
//!   named risk of #3283).
//! - Paths are workspace-relative-resolved against the manifest's
//!   directory, then normalized so Windows and POSIX compare equal.
//!
//! ## Metadata-sourced harness validation (#3608, reworked by #3634)
//!
//! The `custom_harness` verdict sources its workspace membership and its
//! test-target inventory from `cargo metadata` itself instead of a
//! manifest TOML emulation: one bounded `cargo metadata --no-deps
//! --offline` probe per batch reports cargo's own member resolution
//! (glob and character-class member patterns, exclude handling, and
//! every path-dependency form including `[workspace.dependencies]`
//! inheritance) and every test target cargo would compile. The `harness`
//! flag is absent from metadata output by construction (verified on the
//! pinned toolchain), so the flag premise still comes from parsing the
//! owning package manifest. An unavailable probe — no cargo binary, a
//! workspace cargo rejects, or an unreadable probe output — fails closed
//! to `manifest_unavailable`: a registration grants nothing, never
//! over-credits.
