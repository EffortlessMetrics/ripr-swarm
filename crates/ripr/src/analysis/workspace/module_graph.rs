//! Module-tree reachability evidence for changed Rust files (#4435).
//!
//! The layout rule alone decides too much: any file under `src/` (or below a
//! declared crate root outside `src/`) seeded diff probes even when no `mod`
//! names it, so rustc never compiles it; and the out-of-line modules of an
//! external crate root (`[lib] path = "../shared/lib.rs"`) never seeded,
//! because their nearest manifest is not the declaring package.
//!
//! This pass walks the module tree of the packages that could compile a
//! changed file, from every Cargo target root, following `mod`, `#[path]` and
//! literal `include!` edges, and records two facts on the source-role
//! context:
//!
//! - **orphans**: the owning package's walk is complete and does not reach
//!   the file, so no target compiles it. It seeds no probes.
//! - **external module sources**: a package whose `[lib]`/`[[bin]]` root sits
//!   outside its own directory reaches the file from that root. It seeds.
//! - **unresolved routes**: no resolved edge reaches the file, but a `mod`
//!   the owning package's walk meets has an unresolved `#[path]` that spells
//!   it (`#[cfg_attr(unix, path = "unix.rs")] mod sys;`), directly or through
//!   that target's own children. It seeds, and the run names the
//!   declaration, because ripr composes no module context for the file.
//!
//! Unknown never proves absence. A walk that meets an edge the scan cannot
//! resolve (dynamic `#[path]`, `cfg_if!`-wrapped declarations, a parse error,
//! the file bound) is incomplete, and the package keeps the layout rule. An
//! orphan verdict additionally needs every Rust file in the workspace to scan
//! completely, since another package can reach into this one through
//! `#[path]`, `include!` or a macro that expands to either.
//!
//! Not modeled, as in rust-analyzer's module discovery without expansion: an
//! attribute or derive macro, or a statement-position macro call, that emits
//! a `#[path]` module; a package outside the workspace root whose target
//! path points into it; and case-insensitive path matching. Each would need
//! a file-level edge no Rust source in the workspace spells.
//! Roots are over-collected on purpose (every autodiscovered and declared
//! target, whatever `autobins`/`autotests` say): an extra root can only
//! reach more files, which keeps a verdict of "unreached" conservative.
//!
//! The pass runs only over the files the caller names (the changed files
//! for the diff loop, the finding anchors for the LSP partition), so both
//! surfaces reach the same verdict for the same file and neither pays for
//! packages the diff never touched.
