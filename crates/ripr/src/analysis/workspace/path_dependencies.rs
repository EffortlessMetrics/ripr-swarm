//! Forward/reverse path-dependency adjacency (#2969, slice B of #2665).
//!
//! Built deterministically in memory from the path-dependency edges captured
//! by slice A (#2968/#3037, see
//! [`crate::analysis::seam_cache::PathDependencyEdge`]). No network, no
//! filesystem walking of dependencies, no Cargo invocation: node identities
//! are the captured repo-relative manifest paths and the lexically resolved
//! dependency paths, so the graph answers "which manifests does this manifest
//! reach through path dependencies" (forward) and "which manifests reach this
//! manifest" (reverse) without implying that any registry or external
//! dependency metadata was resolved. External dependency provenance stays
//! `unavailable`.
//!
//! Honesty contract:
//!
//! - all iteration is `BTreeMap`/`BTreeSet`-ordered, so no neighbor list or
//!   walk result depends on hash-map iteration order;
//! - edges without a resolved identity (`UnsupportedAbsolutePath`,
//!   `UnresolvedWorkspaceInheritance`, `InvalidDeclaration`) cannot
//!   participate in the adjacency; that gap is disclosed through
//!   `connected_edge_count` and the status detail, never silently dropped;
//! - a cycle terminates the walk and is disclosed as a cycle marker (the
//!   back-edge target), never recursed into;
//! - a non-empty capture-limitation list means the captured edge inventory is
//!   partial, so the status degrades to `limited` and says so;
//! - when no path dependency was declared at all the status is `complete`
//!   with an empty node set and the detail states that truthfully.
//!
//! Scope boundary: this module builds and exposes the graph, and (#2970
//! slice C) computes the reverse-dependency diff-scope expansion that the
//! Rust adapter feeds into the Draft/Fast package selection. Dep-driven
//! impact analysis beyond scope expansion is still future work.
