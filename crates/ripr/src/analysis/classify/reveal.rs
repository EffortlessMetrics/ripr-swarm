/// For `MatchArm` probes, `has_token_match` uses only the **variant** tokens

/// the shared qualifier token `Mode` is excluded from the confirmation set.
/// When the expression contains no `::` (e.g. `None => 0,`), the variant
/// token list is empty and variant matching contributes nothing. String
/// literals in the arm PATTERN additionally confirm, but only when supplied
/// as inputs to the changed owner (`route("sensor")`): result-side literals
/// never confirm (a sibling returning the same literal does not select this
/// arm), and diagnostic/message literals never confirm. The owner's bare
/// callee name scopes the match; without a known owner nothing confirms.
///
/// For probes whose changed expression constructs an exact error variant,
/// with `ExactErrorVariant` assertions (RIPR-SPEC-0106, Part B): when
/// `error_construction_variant` is `Some`, the oracle is gated on the changed
/// expression's specific variant token:
/// - `ErrorPath` probes: the assertion must pin that variant to match at all.
///   A sibling-variant assertion (`CalcError::Negative`) does not associate
///   with a `CalcError::TooLarge` probe — both share the `CalcError`
///   qualifier token, but only the variant token (`TooLarge`) is specific.
/// - Other direct families (e.g. a `return_value` or `field_construction`
///   probe on an `Err(...)` construction): the assertion stays associated
///   through the standard match rules, but only a variant-pinned text sets
///   `has_token_match`, so a sibling-variant oracle leaves observation
///   unverified instead of crediting discrimination for an unrelated seam.
///
/// Without `error_construction_variant` (probe has no parseable variant),
/// falls back to the standard `token_match` behavior — except for #3700
/// wrapper error seams (`context.wrapper_seam` is `true`), where lexical
/// matching can never confirm observation: the variant binding of a
/// `map_err` conversion is not statically establishable, so the seam stays
/// below `exposed` and carries the typed
/// `wrapper_error_binding_unresolved` limitation.
///
/// A `GuardedResultMatch` assertion confirms a probe only through the
/// producer-owned binding, under five #3731 fail-closed gates: the
/// synthesized text must embed a BARE one-segment scrutinee
/// (`match <owner>(..)` — a qualified path's identity is unresolvable
/// here, #3727), when the changed expression constructs an exact
/// error variant the guarded pin must name that exact variant, the
/// related test's file must not import the owner callee's bare name from
/// a FOREIGN path (a same-name import makes the bare binding ambiguous —
/// see `use_statements_import_foreign_callee_name`), the test's own package
/// must not define a same-named function while the changed owner lives in
/// another package (a bare call may bind the test package's own function —

    //
    // #3731 review, four fail-closed gates on the owner shortcut:
    // - BARE scrutinee only. The synthesized text embeds the scrutinee path
    //   after `match `, so a one-segment scrutinee reads `match <callee>(`;
    //   a qualified path (`match helpers::parse(..)`) names an entity this
    //   lexical view cannot resolve to the probe owner (an imported or
    //   re-exported same-named callee is exactly the token-coincidence
    //   family), so its observation stays unverified. Qualified-path
    //   identity resolution is the #3727 follow-up.
    // - Exact variant when the changed expression constructs one. A probe
    //   with an `error_construction_variant` is confirmed only when the
    //   guarded oracle's pin names that exact variant; a sibling-variant
    //   (or type-only) guard does not observe the changed error
    //   (RIPR-SPEC-0106 Part B, mirrored from the ExactErrorVariant gate).
    // - No foreign same-name import in the related test's file (F11). An
    //   import of the callee's bare name from a path outside the analyzed
    //   crate makes the bare binding ambiguous between the owner and the
    //   imported callee, so the confirmation is refused (fail-closed
    //   under-credit). An own-crate import (`use this_crate::callee;` — the
    //   normal integration-test binding) is the owner's own export and does
    //   not defeat.
    // - No same-named function in the test's OWN package when the owner
    //   lives in another package (G1). The RustIndex knows the test
    //   package's own functions; a bare `match <callee>(..)` scrutinee in
    //   that test may bind the local definition instead of the owner, so
    //   the confirmation is refused (fail-closed under-credit).
    // - Ok-arm observation for success-payload return-value probes
    //   (RIPR-SPEC-0175). A return-value probe whose changed expression
    //   does NOT construct an exact error variant is a probe on the
    //   owner's returned success value: it is discriminated only when the
    //   match's Ok arm observes the unwrapped value. The routing form (no
    //   Ok arm — the success value flows into a trivial catch-all) and a
    //   payload-ignoring `Ok(_) => ..` arm never observe a changed Ok
    //   value, so the confirmation is refused (fail closed, under-credit;
    //   the extraction-time `ok_value_observed` decision rides the fact).
    //   A return-value probe on an exact Err construction keeps the
    //   Err-guard discriminator — the pin gate above names the changed
    //   variant — the same principle that leaves ErrorPath probes
    //   unchanged here.
