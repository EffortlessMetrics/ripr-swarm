//! Bounded transitive-reach check for Rust `no_static_path` findings.
//!
//! When the direct-call classifier finds no related test (ExposureClass::NoStaticPath),
//! this module runs a depth-bounded breadth-first walk over the lexical call facts
//! in the RustIndex to detect whether any test may plausibly reach the changed owner
//! through a transitive call chain.
//!
//! ## Fail-closed design (RIPR-SPEC-0114)
//!
//! - The walk is pure NAME matching over lexical call facts - no AST resolution.
//! - Depth is bounded at 5 hops (`MAX_TRANSITIVE_DEPTH`).
//! - The walk stops (and NAMES the limitation) at any boundary:
//!   macro invocations (`name!`), callee names not found in the production
//!   function set, or depth > 5.
//! - Finding classification NEVER changes: `no_static_path` stays `no_static_path`.
//!   This check only sets `static_limit_kind` to name the limitation.
//! - If no candidate transitive path is found the finding is left exactly as-is.
