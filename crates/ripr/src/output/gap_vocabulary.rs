//! One shared authority for the cross-surface presentation of the shared
//! weak gap state (issue #4381).
//!
//! The same gap state — "related tests reach the change, but no
//! discriminator would notice" — is named by two published schema tokens:
//! `weakly_exposed` (the exposure/probe class, `ripr check`) and
//! `weakly_gripped` (the seam grip class, `ripr pilot`, seam packets, and
//! evidence records). Both tokens are consumed by external contracts —
//! JSON packets, evidence records, SARIF, config `[severity]` keys, and LSP
//! diagnostic codes — so **neither token changes** (the decision recorded in
//! `docs/STATIC_EXPOSURE_MODEL.md`, option B of #4381, consistent with the
//! PR #4520 wording decision). The exposure and grip domains remain two
//! contracts; this module is the only presentation mapping between them
//! and the only home of the shared discriminator phrasing. Per-surface
//! translation forks — a local `"weakly_gripped" => "weakly_exposed"` table
//! in a renderer — are forbidden; `no_per_surface_translation_forks` below
//! is the drift guard.
//!
//! The mapping is intentionally one-directional: grip-to-exposure. The
//! reverse is not one-to-one (several grip classes present as
//! `static_unknown`), so no reverse lookup is offered and surfaces must not
//! invent one.

/// The canonical sentence every consumer-facing surface quotes for the
/// shared missing-discriminator state. `ripr check` renders it as the
/// `WeaklyExposed` classification hint; the pilot/agent surfaces compose it
/// when they describe the same state, so an agent matching on phrases sees
/// one sentence, not a per-surface variant.
