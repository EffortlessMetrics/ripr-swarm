//! TypeScript preview → complete repair-packet projection (RIPR-SPEC-0087 §PR7).
//!
//! This module implements the **projection** side of the
//! TypeScript-actionability gate: it reads evidence lines from a
//! `preview`-language finding and — when every precondition in §1.2 holds —
//! builds a `GapRecord` that can be fed to the **shared** Rust validator
//! `validate_agent_gap_record_packet` to determine `repair_packet_ready`.
//!
//! Architectural constraints (non-negotiable):
//! - The validator lives in `output::agent_seam_packets`; this module may call
//!   it because both modules are inside `output/`.
//! - Analysis modules (`analysis/**`) must NOT import `crate::output`, so the
//!   projection CANNOT live there.
//! - No parallel TypeScript-specific completeness validator is introduced.
//!   The only flip gate is `validate_agent_gap_record_packet(..) == Ok(())`.
