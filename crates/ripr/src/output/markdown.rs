///   caller under-emits — bash form plus
///   [`POWERSHELL_UNAVAILABLE_DISCLOSURE`] — instead of shipping a line that
///   is invalid or semantically different (PR #3625 review, devin BUG).
/// - PowerShell single quotes are also literal inside, but its doubling idiom
///   differs: bash closes, escapes, and reopens (`'\''`) where PowerShell
///   doubles in place (`''`), so every occurrence is rewritten.
/// - bash `>` redirection becomes a .NET write with BOM-free UTF-8, so Windows
///   PowerShell 5.1 does not produce a UTF-16 or BOM-prefixed file that JSON
///   consumers would reject. The target is rendered as a PowerShell string
///   literal — method-call arguments parse in expression mode, where a bare
///   path is a parse error (PR #3617 review) — and the redirect is detected
///   only outside single- and double-quoted regions, so a quoted `>` inside
///   an argument cannot hijack it. A quote of the other kind is literal data.
///   A second redirect withholds: anything after the first operator is the
///   artifact path, and `>` is not a valid Windows filename character.
/// - The artifact write is guarded: the invocation's output is captured, the
///   write happens only `if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0)`, and a nonzero status
///   throws `"ripr exited with code $LASTEXITCODE"`. Without the guard, a
///   nonzero `ripr` exit still published the artifact and exited 0, so a
///   failed step looked complete (PR #3625 review, codex P1). The failure
///   surfaces as `throw`, not `exit`: `throw` aborts a pasted or scripted
///   block — so in a composed fence a failed snapshot stops the sequence
///   before its outcome command — while leaving an interactive session open
///   where `exit` would close it (PR #3625 follow-up review).
/// - The captured text is normalized back to LF before the write:
///   `Out-String` reflows producer stdout to CRLF line endings, which
///   rewrote every byte of a pasted snapshot and broke `agent verify`
///   content commitments (issue #3966). Producers emit LF-only stdout, so
///   collapsing CRLF pairs restores the exact producer bytes the
///   commitment was computed over; the write then preserves them with
///   BOM-free UTF-8. A producer emitting raw CR bytes would need a
///   different transport — none exists on main.
///
/// cmd.exe has no translation: it has no quoting form that keeps an argv token
/// literal, so a generated command is deliberately not offered for it. This
/// lives beside the markdown render helpers because every generated-command
/// surface renders both shell variants from this one implementation.
