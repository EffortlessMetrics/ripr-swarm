pub(super) const INIT_HELP: &str = r#"Write an optional repo policy file (ripr.toml) and, with --ci github, a non-blocking advisory workflow.

Usage: ripr init [--root PATH] [--ci github] [--dry-run] [--force]

`ripr init` is optional. It writes the built-in defaults to a repo-local
ripr.toml so teams can commit, review, and tune policy. Missing ripr.toml is
the normal first-run state and uses the same defaults. Running `ripr init` does
not unlock basic CLI, editor, or pilot usefulness.

Options:
  --root PATH      Workspace root where ripr.toml should be written. Defaults to current directory.
  --ci github      Also write .github/workflows/ripr.yml with advisory reports and optional SARIF rendering/upload.
  --dry-run        Print the generated config without writing.
  --force          Overwrite an existing ripr.toml or generated workflow.

Generated config:
  - uses draft analysis mode and includes unchanged tests
  - shows actionable weak or missing seams with default severities
  - hides seams whose configured severity is off
  - records the built-in saved-workspace LSP seam diagnostic default
  - remains advisory and does not configure CI blocking or mutation execution

Generated GitHub workflow:
  - installs ripr and writes a pilot packet plus repo report artifacts
  - uploads report artifacts and writes a reviewer-oriented advisory summary
  - surfaces future PR test guidance reports as non-blocking check annotations
  - renders and uploads diff/repo SARIF only while RIPR_UPLOAD_SARIF is true
  - uses continue-on-error for advisory RIPR work and upload steps
  - does not enable baseline failure policy by default
"#;
pub(super) const PILOT_HELP: &str = r#"Find the top test gap in this repo and write a packet you can act on.

Usage: ripr pilot [--root PATH] [--out PATH] [--mode MODE] [--max-seams N] [--timeout-ms MS]

Options:
  --root PATH       Workspace root to analyze. Defaults to current directory.
  --out PATH        Output directory for the pilot packet. Defaults to target/ripr/pilot.
  --mode MODE       instant, draft, fast, deep, or ready. Defaults to draft unless ripr.toml sets one.
  --max-seams N     Maximum ranked seams in the pilot summary. Defaults to 5.
  --timeout-ms MS   Maximum analysis budget before writing a partial summary. Defaults to 30000.

Outputs:
  - repo-exposure.json and repo-exposure.md
  - agent-seam-packets.json
  - pilot-summary.json and pilot-summary.md

The pilot packet is advisory. It reports saved-workspace static seam evidence
and points to one next focused test action; it does not run mutation testing,
edit source files, or configure CI policy. If analysis exceeds the timeout,
pilot-summary.json and pilot-summary.md are written with status=partial and an
explicit retry command.
"#;
pub(super) const OUTCOME_HELP: &str = r#"Compare before/after static evidence after adding a focused test.

Usage: ripr outcome --before PATH --after PATH [--format md|json] [--out PATH]

Options:
  --before PATH    Static snapshot before the focused test: repo exposure or check JSON.
  --after PATH     Static snapshot after the focused test: repo exposure or check JSON.
  --format FORMAT  md, markdown, text, or json. Defaults to md.
  --out PATH       Write the rendered receipt to a file instead of stdout.

The outcome receipt is advisory. It compares static repo-exposure snapshots by
seam_id and check-output snapshots by canonical_gap_id, then reports moved,
unchanged, regressed, new, and removed gaps or seams. Its
review receipt summarizes what changed, what RIPR flagged before, which focused
proof signals moved, what remains weak or unknown, and what reviewers should
inspect or avoid inferring. It does not run analysis, edit source, generate
tests, run mutation testing, claim runtime correctness or coverage adequacy,
approve merges, or decide CI policy.

pub(super) const CHECK_HELP: &str = r#"Analyze a diff or workspace and emit findings in human, JSON, SARIF, or badge form.

Usage: ripr check [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --root PATH              Workspace root. Defaults to current directory.
  --base REV               Base revision for git diff. Defaults to origin/main.
  --diff PATH              Read a unified diff file instead of running git diff.
  --mode MODE              instant, draft, fast, deep, or ready. Defaults to draft.
  --format FORMAT          human, json, github, sarif, badge-json, badge-shields,
                           badge-plus-json, badge-plus-shields, repo-badge-json,

                           repo-sarif, agent-seam-packets-json. Defaults to human.
                           badge-plus-* and repo-badge-plus-* formats read
                           target/ripr/reports/test-efficiency.json when present;
                           missing input renders a neutral "needs test-efficiency"
                           badge and warns on stderr. See docs/BADGE_ADOPTION.md.
                           repo-* and agent-seam-packets-json formats render
                           against the full repo baseline; the non-repo badge-*
                           formats remain diff-scoped.
  --gap-ledger PATH        For repo-badge-* formats only, render badge counts
                           from explicit gap-decision-ledger projection targets
                           instead of seam-native/test-efficiency counts.
  --json                   Shortcut for --format json.
  --no-unchanged-tests     Limit the index to changed Rust files.

Examples:
  ripr check
  ripr check --base HEAD~1
  ripr check --diff crates/ripr/examples/sample/example.diff --format github
  ripr check --mode ready --json

pub(super) const DOCTOR_HELP: &str = r#"Diagnose the local ripr setup (Rust toolchain, workspace, paths).

Usage: ripr doctor [--root PATH]

Checks:
  - root directory exists
  - Cargo.toml is present at the selected root
  - ripr.toml load status and effective defaults are visible
  - git, cargo, and rustc are available

Start-here next step:
  - after setup is valid, run `ripr first-pr --root . --base origin/main --head HEAD`
    or `ripr start-here --root . --base origin/main --head HEAD`
    or this repo's `cargo xtask first-pr` wrapper
  - open `target/ripr/reports/start-here.md` first when it exists
  - safe next action means repair one named gap, regenerate missing or malformed
    evidence, refresh stale evidence, fix wrong-root setup, or stop on no-action
  - treat missing artifact, stale evidence, wrong root, malformed artifact,
    no actionable gap, and preview-limited evidence as explicit stop or
    regeneration states, not hidden success
  - verify command, receipt command, and receipt path are the static proof rail;
    receipts stay advisory and do not prove runtime adequacy or gate approval
