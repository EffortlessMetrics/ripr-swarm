//! Typed workflow catalog and bounded `help workflow` discovery.
//!
//! RIPR-SPEC-0188 / issue #4824 (command-discovery C3). The C1 catalog
//! ([`crate::cli::command_catalog`]) owns command identity and the C2 metadata
//! table ([`crate::cli::command_metadata`]) owns per-command cost, side
//! effects, and artifacts; this module owns workflow identity: ordered command
//! relationships, result families, stop/recovery boundaries, and the human
//! workflow renderer. Workflows summarize command facts from the C2 table and
//! can never override or strengthen them (required control 5 enforces this at
//! catalog-check time).
//!
//! Out of scope for this slice: `help --json` (RIPR-SPEC-0189 / #4825), command
//! execution, and any change to underlying command behavior. The repair
//! workflow consumes the durable-attempt contract; it never re-implements the
//! #2927 lifecycle and never implies ripr performs the user edit, runs tests,
//! or closes an attempt.
