//! One long-lived thread for every LSP analysis refresh.
//!
//! Refreshes used to run through `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`, which hands
//! each one to whichever blocking-pool thread is free. glibc gives each
//! thread its own malloc arena and keeps freed pages in it, so after a few
//! refreshes landed on different threads the server held one analysis peak
//! per arena: on ripr-swarm's 15-commit diff RSS grew from ~590 MB after the
//! first refresh to ~1.15 GB after the second, while a single-arena run stayed
//! at ~635 MB. Running every refresh on one thread keeps it in one arena.
//!
//! Refreshes are already serialized by the scheduler's execution gate, so a
//! single thread costs no concurrency. A job that panics fails only its own
//! caller, as with `spawn_blocking`: the thread catches the unwind and goes on
//! to the jobs queued behind it. If the thread is ever gone, the next job
//! starts a fresh one.
