//! Shared owned-subprocess authority for bounded commands (#3803).
//!
//! Every shipped bounded subprocess path — the git invocation helpers, the
//! Perl facts exporter probe, the cargo metadata probe, and the `xtask`
//! timed-command runners — spawns its child through [`OwnedProcess`] so one
//! typed owner holds the process, its termination, wait and cleanup. On
//! Windows the owner guarantees Job Object containment with
//! assign-before-execution:
//!
//! ```text
//! create primary process suspended (CREATE_SUSPENDED)
//! → create Job Object + assign the suspended process
//! → resume execution
//! → bounded observation by the caller
//! → on timeout/cancellation/error terminate the owned job
//! → wait/reap the primary process
//! → only then release ownership
//! ```
//!
//! Because the assignment happens before any child user code can run, every
//! descendant the child later spawns joins the job, and terminating the job
//! (or ending ownership) kills the whole tree. No orphaned descendant can
//! outlive the owner to hold Windows file or working-directory locks. This
//! replaces the previous `taskkill /PID <pid> /T /F` shell dependency, whose
//! snapshot-based tree walk was racy (#3096, #1022) and which silently
//! degraded to a direct-child kill whenever `taskkill` was missing or
//! reported success before the parent had exited.
//!
//! Ownership is never dropped without cleanup: [`Drop`] terminates the job
//! and reaps the direct child even on panic unwinding. Non-Windows targets
//! keep their existing behavior: a transparent `std::process::Child`
//! passthrough whose termination kills and reaps the direct child, with the
//! Unix process-group authority unchanged in its callers.
