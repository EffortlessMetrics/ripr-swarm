# ripr

`ripr` helps Rust developers and coding agents find test-oracle gaps before
mutation testing.

It answers a draft-time testing question:

```text
For the behavior changed in this diff, do the current tests appear to contain
a discriminator that would notice if that behavior were wrong?
```

`ripr` is alpha software. The current release is a syntax-first scanner that is
useful for early feedback, not a proof system.

This is the product repository for `ripr`. The `0.6.x` line keeps the analyzer,
editor, CI, and agent loops aligned around static evidence, preview-language
visibility, and repo-local operating packets for targeted tests.

The first-hour docs lead with plain language; internal terms (seam,
discriminator, oracle, grip, canonical gap) live in the spec/schema layer.
See the [Terminology bridge](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/ripr/blob/main/docs/TERMINOLOGY.md)
for the mapping.

## Mission

`ripr` helps Rust developers and coding agents write tests that actually notice
changed behavior.

It performs static RIPR exposure analysis over changed Rust code, creates
mutation-shaped probes, and reports whether existing tests appear to contain the
discriminators needed to expose those changes.

It is a fast draft-mode companion to real mutation testing: static guidance
while the pull request is moving, real mutation confirmation when the change is
ready.

## Vision

The vision for `ripr` is to become the live static mutation-exposure layer
between coverage signals and runtime mutation confirmation for Rust/Cargo
workspaces.

Coverage tells developers what executed. Mutation testing tells developers what
survived. `ripr` tells developers, reviewers, and agents what changed behavior
appears to lack a meaningful oracle before the expensive mutation run begins.

The end state is an LSP-native sidecar that watches changed code, identifies
missing discriminators, explains the evidence path, emits agent-ready test
intent, and calibrates itself against real mutation outcomes.

## Category

`ripr` defines its category as:

```text
Static Mutation Exposure Analysis
```

More specifically:

```text
Static oracle-gap analysis for diff-derived mutation probes.
```

The tool is not trying to be a coverage dashboard, a full mutation engine, a
proof system, a second rust-analyzer, or a generic LLM test generator. Its job is
to shorten the path from "this behavior changed" to "this is the exact test
oracle that should notice."

## What ripr Does

`ripr` reads changed Rust code, creates mutation-shaped probes, and estimates
whether related tests appear to reach, infect, propagate, observe, and
discriminate the changed behavior.

It looks for missing or weak test oracles such as:

- boundary changes without boundary-value assertions
- error-path changes checked only with `is_err()`
- return-value changes checked only with smoke assertions
- field construction changes without field, object, or snapshot assertions
- side effects without mock, event, state, persistence, or metric oracles

## What ripr Does Not Do

`ripr` does not run mutants.

It does not report `killed` or `survived`, prove test adequacy, replace coverage,
or replace real mutation testing. Use a real mutation runner, such as
`cargo-mutants`, when the change is ready for confirmation.

## Where It Fits

```text
coverage:
  did this code execute?

ripr:
  does changed behavior appear exposed to a meaningful oracle?

mutation testing:
  did tests fail when a concrete mutant was run?
```

The goal is fast, honest oracle-gap feedback while code is still changing.

## Ecosystem Positioning

| Existing layer | What it answers | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cargo-llvm-cov` | Did code execute? | Not oracle-aware |
| selective retest tools | Which tests are impacted? | Not assertion-aware |
| `cargo-mutants` | Did real mutants survive? | Too expensive for live draft feedback |
| `rust-analyzer` | What does Rust code mean in the editor? | Does not rank mutation exposure |
| `ripr` | Does changed behavior appear exposed to a meaningful oracle? | New middle layer |

## Install

Install from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install ripr
```

Links:

- crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/ripr
- docs.rs: https://docs.rs/ripr

For local development from this repository:

```bash
cargo install --path crates/ripr
```

`ripr` targets Rust 2024 and requires Rust `1.95` or newer.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check local tooling and workspace shape
ripr doctor

# Analyze the current Git diff against origin/main
ripr check --base origin/main

# Analyze an explicit unified diff
ripr check --diff example.diff

# Emit stable JSON for tools and agents
ripr check --diff example.diff --json

# Emit GitHub Actions annotations
ripr check --diff example.diff --format github

# Explain one finding
ripr explain --diff example.diff probe:src_lib.rs:88:predicate

# Emit an agent-ready context packet
ripr context --diff example.diff --at probe:src_lib.rs:88:predicate --json

# Start the experimental LSP sidecar
ripr lsp
```

## Example Finding

```text
WARNING src/pricing.rs:88

Static exposure: weakly_exposed (predicate, control)

Changed behavior:
  after:  if amount >= discount_threshold {

RIPR:
  Reach:        yes
  Infect:      weak
  Propagate:   yes
  Observe:     yes
  Discriminate: weak

Gap:
  - No detected boundary input for the changed predicate
  - No strong discriminator was detected

Recommended next step:
  Add below, equal, and above threshold tests with exact assertions.
```

## Output Formats

Human output is optimized for local use.

JSON output is versioned and intended for editor integrations, CI, and coding
agents:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "0.1",
  "tool": "ripr",
  "mode": "draft",
  "base": "origin/main",
  "findings": []
}
```

GitHub output emits workflow annotations.

## Classifications

| Classification | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `exposed` | Static evidence suggests a complete RIPR path to a strong oracle. |
| `weakly_exposed` | A path exists, but infection or discrimination appears weak. |
| `reachable_unrevealed` | Related tests appear reachable, but no meaningful oracle was found. |
| `no_static_path` | No static test path was found for the changed owner. |
| `infection_unknown` | Reachability exists, but input or fixture evidence is opaque. |
| `propagation_unknown` | The changed behavior crosses an opaque propagation boundary. |
| `static_unknown` | Syntax-first analysis cannot make a credible judgment. |

## Current Scope

The current alpha line is intentionally narrow:

- one published package: `ripr`
- one CLI binary: `ripr`
- one shared analysis engine
- syntax-first unified diff analysis
- basic Rust function, test, and assertion indexing
- human, JSON, and GitHub outputs
- experimental LSP sidecar

The package is not split into `ripr-core`, `ripr-cli`, or `ripr-lsp`. Public
crate boundaries can be added later if external consumers need them.

## Current Capability Snapshot

`ripr` is currently strongest as a fast, syntax-backed draft signal with a
defaults-first operator loop for finding one weak seam, adding one focused
test, and comparing before/after evidence.

| Capability | Current state | Next checkpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Distribution | `0.6.0` is the current public release line for the Rust crate, VS Code/Open VSX extension, GitHub Release server assets, generated CI workflow artifacts, and Rust 1.95 MSRV. The 0.6.0 release execution closeout verified crates.io, GitHub Release assets, VS Code Marketplace, Open VSX, and install smoke. | Post-release maintenance: keep install and marketplace receipts current. |
| Diff analysis | Syntax-backed changed-line probes with owner symbols, parser-backed probe facts, explicit stop reasons for unknowns, probe-relative oracle strength, and local flow sink facts. | Maintenance; no active analyzer-refactor lane. |
| Test discovery | Parser-backed test and assertion facts with exact, broad, relational, snapshot, mock, smoke, and unknown oracle kinds. | Maintenance; no active analyzer-refactor lane. |
| Output | Human, JSON, context, GitHub/SARIF, repo seam, pilot, outcome, and badge formats include evidence-first stop reasons and advisory next actions. Public `ripr` badges count unresolved actionable static repair gaps, not coverage, mutation adequacy, all behavior seams, or all untested code. | Output contract maintenance. |
| LSP | Experimental `tower-lsp-server` sidecar with saved-workspace seam diagnostics, hovers, targeted context actions, refresh status, and related-test actions. | Editor contract maintenance. |
| Agent context | Context packets and agent seam packets include targeted-test briefs with missing values and assertion shape. | Agent-context v2 when there is a concrete external contract. |
| Calibration | `ripr calibrate cargo-mutants` imports supplied runtime mutation data and joins it to repo seam evidence for advisory static/runtime calibration; `fixtures/EXAMPLE_CORPUS.md` links the checked boundary-gap sample into the operator loop, and `fixtures/boundary_gap/calibration/runtime-fixtures-v1/` pins the main static/runtime agreement buckets. | Maintenance; runtime data stays optional and supplied. |
