# Expected output history

## #5051

Initial public CLI baseline for the governed package/fallback admission control.

## #5051 review correction

Opaque property-only call arguments and lexical fallback bodies provide no reach, infection or propagation proof. Known unrelated-package mentions cannot suppress a real gap.

## Pending — property_macro_lexical_fallback (1)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: check names the one-step ripr agent stub route for Rust value gaps (#5355)

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless property_macro_lexical_fallback --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — property_macro_lexical_fallback (2)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122 #5312: human-full before: shows the same canonical span as after (the removed line is projected onto the probe expression span); classifications, stages, JSON, and ids unchanged

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless property_macro_lexical_fallback --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`
