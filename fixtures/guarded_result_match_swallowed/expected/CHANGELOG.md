Updated:
- `expected/check.json`

## Pending — guarded_result_match_swallowed (2)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0154: re-bless to settle human-full trailing-format drift after the guarded Result match producer landed (#3709)

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_swallowed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — guarded_result_match_swallowed (3)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0084: CheckInput default base is now None (was origin/main); --diff fixture envelopes honestly omit the inapplicable top-level base and record base_revision null. Only base/base_revision changed; findings, counts, and input_identity byte-identical.

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_swallowed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`
