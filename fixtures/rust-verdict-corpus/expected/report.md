# Rust verdict corpus report

Spec: RIPR-SPEC-0219. Corpus version: 2026-10-04.9. Cases: 203.

| Rate | Count | Rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| False verdicts (all cases) | 67/203 | 0.3300 |
| False actionable (of discriminated) | 61/106 | 0.5755 |
| False exposed (of not fully discriminated) | 6/97 | 0.0619 |
| False silent (of not fully discriminated) | 0/97 | 0.0000 |
| Ideal verdict | 78/203 | 0.3842 |
| Abstained (limited or silent where acceptable) | 58/203 | 0.2857 |
| Findings with a contradiction | 0/278 | 0.0000 |

By subject origin. Authored cases are written to fill cells the upstream cases leave empty, so only the upstream rates describe real-world tests.

Non-claims:

- Rates describe this corpus only; they are not a population estimate for Rust code or for ripr in general.
- Authored cases were written to fill verdict and probe-family cells the upstream cases leave empty; their rates are reported separately under by_origin and are not real-world rates.
- Truth comes from the listed mutants, not from exhaustive mutation; a discriminated label means every listed mutant made the test command fail.
- The harness runs ripr on retained upstream excerpts and on whole authored crates; excerpt findings matched the full pinned checkout at labeling time and must be re-checked when a verdict changes.
- The harness does not run mutation testing, cargo test, or any network access.
