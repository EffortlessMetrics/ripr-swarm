Non-claims:

- Rates describe this corpus only; they are not a population estimate for Rust code or for ripr in general.
- Truth comes from the listed mutants, not from exhaustive mutation; a discriminated label means every listed mutant made the test command fail.
- The harness runs ripr on retained upstream excerpts; excerpt findings matched the full pinned checkout at labeling time and must be re-checked when a verdict changes.
- The harness does not run mutation testing, cargo test, or any network access.
