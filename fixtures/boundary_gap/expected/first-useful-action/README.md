# First Useful Action Fixture Corpus

These files pin the Campaign 22 first-useful-action routing corpus for
`RIPR-SPEC-0020`.

They are static fixture artifacts. They do not implement `ripr first-action`,
edit source, generate tests, call a provider, run mutation testing, rerun
hidden analysis, invent policy, or change CI blocking behavior.

Files:

- `corpus.json` records PR-shaped input states and expected first-action
  routing results for the bounded statuses in RIPR-SPEC-0020.
- `<case>/first-useful-action.json` and `<case>/first-useful-action.md` pin the
  expected report output for each route.
- `unchanged-after-attempt/{before,after}.repo-exposure.json`,
  `unchanged-after-attempt/agent-verify.json`,
  `unchanged-after-attempt/assistant-proof.json`, and
  `unchanged-after-attempt/agent-receipt.json` are dedicated negative-control
  inputs. The repo-exposure files are portable normalized goldens of the real
  `ripr check --root fixtures/boundary_gap/input --format repo-exposure-json`
  output: the corpus test requires the producer to emit the canonical absolute
  fixture root before normalizing root, revision, and worktree currentness for
  checkout-independent storage. The verify artifact and receipt bind the exact
  normalized snapshot bytes and their empty evidence delta. They intentionally
  remain weak/unchanged when the canonical boundary-gap journey advances to
  improved evidence.

The corpus intentionally covers:

- actionable PR-local weak seam;
- stale evidence;
- missing required artifact;
- baseline-only debt;
- acknowledged item;
- waived item;
- suppressed item;
- no actionable seam;
- already-improved receipt state;
- unchanged-after-attempt receipt state.

Case directories:

- `actionable/`
- `stale/`
- `missing-required-artifact/`
- `baseline-only/`
- `acknowledged/`
- `waived/`
- `suppressed/`
- `no-actionable-seam/`
- `already-improved/`
- `unchanged-after-attempt/`

Each case pins the expected status, action kind, audience, selected seam,
target, routing reason, fallback state, command expectations, and static
limits. The report producer, generated CI projection, editor status projection,
and dogfood receipt checks all use this corpus as the regression contract.

`cargo xtask dogfood` also treats the following cases as repo-local first-action
receipts:

- `actionable/`
- `baseline-only/`
- `stale/`
- `missing-required-artifact/`
- `unchanged-after-attempt/`
- `no-actionable-seam/`

Those dogfood checks prove that the documented first useful action routes stay
reviewable from checked artifacts. They remain advisory and do not rerun hidden
analysis, edit source, generate tests, call providers, run mutation testing,
invent policy, or change CI blocking.
