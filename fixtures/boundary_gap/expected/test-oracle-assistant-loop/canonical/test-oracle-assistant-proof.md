Status: advisory

Top focused test:
- Seam: src/lib.rs:2

- Related test: tests/pricing.rs::below_threshold_has_no_discount
- Assertion shape: assert_eq!(discounted_total(/* boundary input where amount >= discount_threshold */), /* expected */)
- Verify: ripr agent verify --root fixtures/boundary_gap/input --before target/ripr/workflow/before.repo-exposure.json --after target/ripr/workflow/after.repo-exposure.json --json
