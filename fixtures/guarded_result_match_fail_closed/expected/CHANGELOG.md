# Golden Output Changes

## Pending — guarded_result_match_fail_closed (1)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0174: new fail-closed battery fixture; wrong-owner, variable-bound, shadowed, message-only, and swallowed Err guards never emit the guarded_result_match oracle and every finding stays below exposed (#3709)

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_fail_closed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — guarded_result_match_fail_closed (2)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0084: CheckInput default base is now None (was origin/main); --diff fixture envelopes honestly omit the inapplicable top-level base and record base_revision null. Only base/base_revision changed; findings, counts, and input_identity byte-identical.

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_fail_closed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — guarded_result_match_fail_closed (3)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: human-full carries per-finding drill-in commands (#4379); digest why-line names the incomplete stage; unreached static_unknown asks for a test first

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_fail_closed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — guarded_result_match_fail_closed (4)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: bounded human check output leads the exposure line with the plain word the summary uses (weak, no path, unknown) before the schema value

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_fail_closed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — guarded_result_match_fail_closed (5)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: the analysis outcome and state lines lead with plain words; the id stays in parentheses

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_fail_closed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — guarded_result_match_fail_closed (6)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: #4321 additive per-finding id lines in human-full (drill-in identifiers)

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_fail_closed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`
## Pending — guarded_result_match_fail_closed (6)

Reason:
#4324 / RIPR-SPEC-0122: the bounded digest names all five stage states on one compact Evidence line (reach, infection, propagation, observation, discriminator) instead of letting the positional 2-line detail window hide the decisive stages behind a bare count; the detail window keeps its two lines and the remainder line now reads `N more detail line(s) in --format human-full`. JSON output is unchanged.

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_fail_closed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — guarded_result_match_fail_closed (7)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: bounded human surfaces disclose their windows - post-merge re-bless of the #4320 caps disclosure on the merged tree (origin/main digest Evidence line)

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_fail_closed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`
## Pending — guarded_result_match_fail_closed (6)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: #4321 additive per-finding id lines in human-full (drill-in identifiers)

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_fail_closed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — guarded_result_match_fail_closed (8)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: #4322 summary header names all seven classes with canonical tokens and a shown/total denominator

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_fail_closed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`
## Pending — guarded_result_match_fail_closed (9)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0197 (#4478): conditional bare equality cannot independently supply return-value oracle credit; preserve dedicated guarded-match and ErrorPath authority

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_fail_closed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — guarded_result_match_fail_closed (10)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0197 (#4478, #5020): retain original assertion cardinality after admission; refused equality cannot manufacture singleton mock evidence

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_fail_closed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — guarded_result_match_fail_closed (11)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0197 #5027: conditional Ok equalities cannot supply ErrorPath execution credit; exact family-selected honesty controls require ErrorPath unrevealed while existing ReturnValue remains weak.

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_fail_closed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — guarded_result_match_fail_closed (12)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0197 #5027: conditional Ok equalities cannot supply ErrorPath execution credit; exact family-selected honesty controls require ErrorPath unrevealed while existing ReturnValue remains weak.

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_fail_closed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — guarded_result_match_fail_closed (13)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0197: a refused assert_eq! discloses why it was not credited; a refused context no longer claims no assertion or oracle was detected

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_fail_closed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — guarded_result_match_fail_closed (14)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0197: refusal guidance names the missing standard assert_eq! execution or binding

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_fail_closed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`
