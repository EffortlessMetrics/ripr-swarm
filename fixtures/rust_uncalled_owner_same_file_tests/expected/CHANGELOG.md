# Golden Output Changes

## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (1)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0001: new fixture; an uncalled owner linked to tests only by same-file proximity has weak reach and is not exposed

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (2)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0001: fixture diff.patch drops blank context lines (git diff --check); only input_identity changes

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (3)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0084: re-emit this branch's new fixture under the landed None-default base envelope (top-level base omitted, base_revision null, summary-first ordering); findings, reach, classes and confidences unchanged

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (4)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0001: an owner no test calls, with no production caller and no opaque test macro, has reach no; same-file neighbour tests stay as suggested locations and no longer read as observing it, so the finding is no_static_path instead of weakly_exposed

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (5)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0001: neighbour tests that never call the owner no longer read as activating it either, so infection is no and the headline score drops with it

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (6)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0001: unreached-stage wording says no test can activate, observe or discriminate the change
RIPR-SPEC-0122: human-full carries per-finding drill-in commands (#4379); digest why-line names the incomplete stage; unreached static_unknown asks for a test first

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (7)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0094: re-bless after merging main (#4425 observed-value caps); unreached-owner findings read no_static_path and new-function signature lines are not probed (#4428)

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (8)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: digest Next step wraps instead of cutting the remedy; stop reasons carry a gloss; boxed-wrapper limitation text has no whitespace runs (#4323)
RIPR-SPEC-0122: bounded human check output leads the exposure line with the plain word the summary uses (weak, no path, unknown) before the schema value

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (9)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: the analysis outcome and state lines lead with plain words; the id stays in parentheses

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (10)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: bounded human surfaces disclose their windows - related-test and observed-value caps, digest missing-discriminator and related-test totals, Hidden block names omitted findings by file:line (class) with the all-base-side distinction (#4320); RIPR-SPEC-0152: all-base-side runs name base-side evidence instead of a lower-priority framing

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (11)

Reason:
#4324 / RIPR-SPEC-0122: the bounded digest names all five stage states on one compact Evidence line (reach, infection, propagation, observation, discriminator) instead of letting the positional 2-line detail window hide the decisive stages behind a bare count; the detail window keeps its two lines and the remainder line now reads `N more detail line(s) in --format human-full`. JSON output is unchanged.

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (12)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: #4322 summary header names all seven classes with canonical tokens and a shown/total denominator

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## #5051 plain no-path guidance

Only the selected untyped no-path safe-action sentence changes. Static-limited state, selection, classification, full output and JSON remain unchanged.

## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (13)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: check names the one-step ripr agent stub route for Rust value gaps (#5355)

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (14)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0224: related tests ripr examined stay listed and each names why it misses the change (#5344); verdicts unchanged

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (15)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0002: issue #5996 routes finding locations through the shared workspace-relative owner (analysis::finding_location_text); the fixture-input root prefix (fixtures/<name>/input/...) no longer appears in check.json/human location fields, matching the root-relative form the LSP and MCP surfaces already emitted. The three inherited config_identity drifts in wrapper_seam_callee_call_attribution reproduce on the base and are not part of this blessing.

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (16)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0002: issue #5996 routes finding locations through the shared workspace-relative owner (analysis::finding_location_text); the fixture-input root prefix (fixtures/<name>/input/...) no longer appears in check.json/human location fields, matching the root-relative form the LSP and MCP surfaces already emitted.
RIPR-SPEC-0045: the Rust producer now populates Finding.canonical_gap and canonical_gap_id (#5268) with the gap:rust identity shape; additive output members only - golden-drift.json shows zero semantic flips (no added/removed findings, no class/oracle/stop-reason changes) across all 388 drifted surfaces

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (17)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0002: merge of origin/main (#5268 canonical_gap for Rust and sibling updates) onto the #5996 workspace-relative location owner — expected files regenerate through the merged tree

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (18)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0116: the check drill-in binds --root to the resolved repository (#3948); goldens carry the <cwd>/ placeholder

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests (19)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122 #5471: stub route printed only when the resolver yields a stub, with --kind; refusal or nothing otherwise (merge re-bless)

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless rust_uncalled_owner_same_file_tests --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
