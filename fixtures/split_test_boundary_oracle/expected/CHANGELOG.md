# Golden Output Changes

## Pending — split_test_boundary_oracle (1)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0186: split-test boundary input and far oracle must not read exposed; names same_test_pairing_missing

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless split_test_boundary_oracle --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — split_test_boundary_oracle (2)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0186: refresh human analysis-outcome line to findings-below wording from #4777; pairing class unchanged

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless split_test_boundary_oracle --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — split_test_boundary_oracle (3)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: bounded human surfaces disclose their windows - related-test and observed-value caps, digest missing-discriminator and related-test totals, Hidden block names omitted findings by file:line (class) with the all-base-side distinction (#4320); RIPR-SPEC-0152: all-base-side runs name base-side evidence instead of a lower-priority framing

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless split_test_boundary_oracle --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — split_test_boundary_oracle (4)

Reason:
#4324 / RIPR-SPEC-0122: the bounded digest names all five stage states on one compact Evidence line (reach, infection, propagation, observation, discriminator) instead of letting the positional 2-line detail window hide the decisive stages behind a bare count; the detail window keeps its two lines and the remainder line now reads `N more detail line(s) in --format human-full`. JSON output is unchanged.

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless split_test_boundary_oracle --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — split_test_boundary_oracle (5)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: #4322 summary header names all seven classes with canonical tokens and a shown/total denominator

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless split_test_boundary_oracle --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
## Pending — split_test_boundary_oracle (6)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0197 (#4478) composition with #4828: the return_value probe reads exposed through the owner-return pin (assert_eq!(gate(100), true)), while the predicate probe keeps same_test_pairing_missing and stays weakly_exposed

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless split_test_boundary_oracle --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — split_test_boundary_oracle (7)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0197/#5027 and RIPR-SPEC-0186: describe the missing admitted boundary-call oracle without asserting that every failed pairing comes from different tests. Classification, confidence, strength and all stage states are unchanged.

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless split_test_boundary_oracle --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — split_test_boundary_oracle (8)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: check names the one-step ripr agent stub route for Rust value gaps (#5355)

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless split_test_boundary_oracle --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — split_test_boundary_oracle (9)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: #5471 check prints the agent stub route only when the stub resolver produces a stub; this route was refused or found no gap, so it is replaced by the refusal reason or removed

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless split_test_boundary_oracle --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — split_test_boundary_oracle (10)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: #5471 agent stub --at resolves on the single-file seam shapes check already judged a gap, without re-classifying, so this route now yields a stub or a different refusal

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless split_test_boundary_oracle --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — split_test_boundary_oracle (11)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: #5471 the stub route carries the finding probe family as --kind, and seams of that kind are tried first; refusals name that seam

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless split_test_boundary_oracle --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
