# Golden Output Changes

## Pending — ts_repair_packet_boundary_literal_guarded (1)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0087: guarded boundary stays non-delegatable (source challenge on #4429)

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless ts_repair_packet_boundary_literal_guarded --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — ts_repair_packet_boundary_literal_guarded (2)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0046 RIPR-SPEC-0047: check JSON now carries a top-level source_subject stamp with the analysis-time content digests of the files a derived gap ledger names (#4544); no finding, classification, or human output changed.
RIPR-SPEC-0122: digest Next step wraps instead of cutting the remedy (#4323, main merge)
RIPR-SPEC-0122: bounded human check output leads the exposure line with the plain word the summary uses (weak, no path, unknown) before the schema value

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless ts_repair_packet_boundary_literal_guarded --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — ts_repair_packet_boundary_literal_guarded (3)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: the analysis outcome and state lines lead with plain words; the id stays in parentheses

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless ts_repair_packet_boundary_literal_guarded --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — ts_repair_packet_boundary_literal_guarded (4)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: bounded human surfaces disclose their windows - related-test and observed-value caps, digest missing-discriminator and related-test totals, Hidden block names omitted findings by file:line (class) with the all-base-side distinction (#4320); RIPR-SPEC-0152: all-base-side runs name base-side evidence instead of a lower-priority framing

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless ts_repair_packet_boundary_literal_guarded --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
