# Golden Output Changes

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (1)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0094 (#4404): unrelated strongest exact oracle must not borrow weaker token confirmation; valid before/head/call-removal variants each pass two tests.

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (2)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: human-full carries per-finding drill-in commands (#4379); fixture added by #4421 before #4411 landed, so its golden lacked the block

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (3)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: bounded human check output leads the exposure line with the plain word the summary uses (weak, no path, unknown) before the schema value

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (4)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: the analysis outcome and state lines lead with plain words; the id stays in parentheses

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (5)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: #4321 additive per-finding id lines in human-full (drill-in identifiers)

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`
## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (5)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: bounded human surfaces disclose their windows - related-test and observed-value caps, digest missing-discriminator and related-test totals, Hidden block names omitted findings by file:line (class) with the all-base-side distinction (#4320); RIPR-SPEC-0152: all-base-side runs name base-side evidence instead of a lower-priority framing

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (6)

Reason:
#4324 / RIPR-SPEC-0122: the bounded digest names all five stage states on one compact Evidence line (reach, infection, propagation, observation, discriminator) instead of letting the positional 2-line detail window hide the decisive stages behind a bare count; the detail window keeps its two lines and the remainder line now reads `N more detail line(s) in --format human-full`. JSON output is unchanged.

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/human.txt`
## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (5)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: #4321 additive per-finding id lines in human-full (drill-in identifiers)

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (7)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: #4322 summary header names all seven classes with canonical tokens and a shown/total denominator

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`
## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (8)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0224: related tests ripr examined stay listed and each names why it misses the change (#5344); verdicts unchanged

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (9)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0224: the strong unconfirmed assertion under oracle_confirmation_mixed now carries observation_unconfirmed; class and stages unchanged

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (10)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0224: a matched related test keeps its oracle kind and strength in full output and adds why it still misses; verdicts unchanged

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (11)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0224, #5508: observation_unconfirmed now reads 'ripr could not confirm that this assertion observes the changed behavior'; human-full re-blessed after rebase onto #5424. No verdict change.

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (12)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0224, #5508: an observation_unconfirmed row is labelled 'unconfirmed:' instead of 'misses:' in human-full. No verdict change.

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (13)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0002: issue #5996 routes finding locations through the shared workspace-relative owner (analysis::finding_location_text); the fixture-input root prefix (fixtures/<name>/input/...) no longer appears in check.json/human location fields, matching the root-relative form the LSP and MCP surfaces already emitted. The three inherited config_identity drifts in wrapper_seam_callee_call_attribution reproduce on the base and are not part of this blessing.

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (14)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0002: issue #5996 routes finding locations through the shared workspace-relative owner (analysis::finding_location_text); the fixture-input root prefix (fixtures/<name>/input/...) no longer appears in check.json/human location fields, matching the root-relative form the LSP and MCP surfaces already emitted.
RIPR-SPEC-0045: the Rust producer now populates Finding.canonical_gap and canonical_gap_id (#5268) with the gap:rust identity shape; additive output members only - golden-drift.json shows zero semantic flips (no added/removed findings, no class/oracle/stop-reason changes) across all 388 drifted surfaces

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (15)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0002: merge of origin/main (#5268 canonical_gap for Rust and sibling updates) onto the #5996 workspace-relative location owner — expected files regenerate through the merged tree

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`
