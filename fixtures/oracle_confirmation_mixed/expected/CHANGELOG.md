# Golden Output Changes

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (1)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0094 (#4404): unrelated strongest exact oracle must not borrow weaker token confirmation; valid before/head/call-removal variants each pass two tests.

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (2)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: human-full carries per-finding drill-in commands (#4379); fixture added by #4421 before #4411 landed, so its golden lacked the block

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (3)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: bounded human check output leads the exposure line with the plain word the summary uses (weak, no path, unknown) before the schema value

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (4)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: the analysis outcome and state lines lead with plain words; the id stays in parentheses

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — oracle_confirmation_mixed (5)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: bounded human surfaces disclose their windows - related-test and observed-value caps, digest missing-discriminator and related-test totals, Hidden block names omitted findings by file:line (class) with the all-base-side distinction (#4320); RIPR-SPEC-0152: all-base-side runs name base-side evidence instead of a lower-priority framing

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless oracle_confirmation_mixed --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`
