# Fixture: match_arm_comment_literal_no_promotion

Spec: RIPR-SPEC-0108

## Given

The changed production match arm maps `sensor` to `sensor-v2` instead of
`sensor-v1`. Its pattern comment contains the quoted text `"focused-test"`.
The only test calls `route("focused-test")` and compares the unchanged
sibling result `"proof"`. The comment does not add an alternative pattern.

## When

```bash
cargo xtask fixtures match_arm_comment_literal_no_promotion
```

or:

```bash
ripr check --root fixtures/match_arm_comment_literal_no_promotion/input --diff fixtures/match_arm_comment_literal_no_promotion/diff.patch --mode fast
```

## Then

The exact changed `match_arm` at `src/lib.rs:3` must remain
`weakly_exposed`, with `observation_unverified`. Preserve the changed arm's
source identity and the real sibling assertion; do not discard either to
avoid the finding. The enclosing match cannot substitute for the arm.

## Must Not

- Promote the changed sensor arm to `exposed` from a value found only in a
  comment.
- Treat nested comments or raw-string-looking comment text as arm values.
- Drop genuine raw or cooked string values containing comment delimiters.
- Weaken the existing aligned input/result positive controls.

## Evidence and qualification boundary

The equivalent public-API negative at test-only head
`8dfd0cebd4a7d02207b0512721b768dc23f0647c` reported `Exposed` instead of
`WeaklyExposed`; the aligned comment positive passed. The retained UB Review
artifact is run `35271299866`, artifact `10519262903`, ZIP SHA-256
`c06c5ba5a3112bc3aca725c78e7f1ee9309287411c2dba4d79ec38d6af94d2c2`.
The corresponding fifteen-test integration target reported fourteen passes
and one failure. The nested negative variant did not run past its earlier
failed assertion; its outcome is not inferred.

This fixture's source and full diff were checked for exact application and
reversal. Committed expected outputs and independent honesty-corpus
registration still need the normal generation and review after the
production correction. No observed bad output is accepted as a golden.
