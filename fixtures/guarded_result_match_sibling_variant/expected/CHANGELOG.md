# Golden Output Changes

## Pending — guarded_result_match_sibling_variant (1)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0175: #3731 review fix F2 — sibling-variant guarded pin must not confirm a variant-carrying probe; new fixture pins the non-promotion (both probes weakly_exposed)

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_sibling_variant --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — guarded_result_match_sibling_variant (2)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0084: CheckInput default base is now None (was origin/main); --diff fixture envelopes honestly omit the inapplicable top-level base and record base_revision null. Only base/base_revision changed; findings, counts, and input_identity byte-identical.

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_sibling_variant --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`

## Pending — guarded_result_match_sibling_variant (3)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: bounded human surfaces disclose their windows - related-test and observed-value caps, digest missing-discriminator and related-test totals, Hidden block names omitted findings by file:line (class) with the all-base-side distinction (#4320); RIPR-SPEC-0152: all-base-side runs name base-side evidence instead of a lower-priority framing

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless guarded_result_match_sibling_variant --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
- `expected/human-full.txt`
