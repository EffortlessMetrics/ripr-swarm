# Golden Output Changes

## Pending

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0153: initial bench-evidence fixture (#3283)

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless benches_harness_evidence --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0160: the additive git_candidate_subject identity field (null for ordinary runs) in the check JSON identity block

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless benches_harness_evidence --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — benches_harness_evidence (2)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0084: CheckInput default base is now None (was origin/main); --diff fixture envelopes honestly omit the inapplicable top-level base and record base_revision null. Only base/base_revision changed; findings, counts, and input_identity byte-identical.

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless benches_harness_evidence --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — benches_harness_evidence (3)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0082/RIPR-SPEC-0122 wording owner change (PR #3978): Why lines re-derived from reach/observe stage state, preview notes use language display names with singular file counts, recovery detail lines end with exactly one period; mechanical re-render of unchanged fixture evidence

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless benches_harness_evidence --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — benches_harness_evidence (4)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0001 (#4216 row 5): brace-only and else-only changed lines (`}`, `} else {`) no longer seed static_unknown probes. Only those findings are removed; every remaining finding is byte-identical, and summary/outcome counts drop by the removed count.

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless benches_harness_evidence --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — benches_harness_evidence (5)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: human-full carries per-finding drill-in commands (#4379); digest why-line names the incomplete stage; unreached static_unknown asks for a test first

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless benches_harness_evidence --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — benches_harness_evidence (6)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: omit zero-count languages, keep the empty-result caveat to empty runs, cut digest lines at word boundaries

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless benches_harness_evidence --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
