# Golden Output Changes

## Pending — boundary_named_constant (1)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0001: new fixture pinning named-constant boundaries: a same-file integer const resolves to its value, a test argument naming the const matches by identity, and an unresolvable const is reported as unknown instead of a missing discriminator

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless boundary_named_constant --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`

## Pending — boundary_named_constant (2)

Reason:
RIPR-SPEC-0122: bounded human surfaces disclose their windows - related-test and observed-value caps, digest missing-discriminator and related-test totals, Hidden block names omitted findings by file:line (class) with the all-base-side distinction (#4320); RIPR-SPEC-0152: all-base-side runs name base-side evidence instead of a lower-priority framing

Command:
`cargo xtask goldens bless boundary_named_constant --reason "..."`

Updated:
- `expected/check.json`
- `expected/human.txt`
